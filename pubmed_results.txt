AB  - In the current study, white-leg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) were fed on diets
      containing varying doses of Withania somnifera aqueous extract (WSAE) at a rate
      of 0 (control), 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0g/kg feed for 56 days. After the feeding trial, 
      shrimp in all groups were challenged with the exposure to Vibrio harveyi for ten 
      days during which animals' mortality was observed. It is noted that the dietary
      WSAE linearly and quadratically stimulated shrimp's growth indices particularly
      at the treatment of 2.0g/kg feed. Compared to the control group, the WSAE-fed L. 
      vannamei had significantly higher villi length, villi width, and absorption area 
      in the treatment of 2.0g/kg feed. Furthermore, L. vannamei fed on WSAE-enriched
      diets consumed more feed and exhibited higher total proteolytic activity, lipase,
      and alpha-amylase activities as compared with the control group. The dietary WSAE
      at escalating levels linearly and quadratically enhanced the antioxidant activity
      (serum superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), 
      total antioxidant capacity, and reduced glutathione) and the immune response
      (total hemocyte counts, total protein, lysozyme, and phagocytic activity).
      Similarly, the mRNA expression levels of cMn-SOD, CAT, and GPx genes were
      linearly and quadratically upregulated in the hepatopancreas of L. vannamei fed
      on WSAE-enriched diets (especially in the 2.0g/kg feed treatment), while their
      lowest levels were significantly observed in the control group. On the other
      hand, malondialdehyde levels were significantly decreased in WSAE-supplemented
      shrimp groups, and its highest levels were observed in animals fed on the control
      diet. After the bacterial exposure, the survival of L. vannamei fed on 1.0 and
      2.0g WSAE/kg feed (61.3% and 66.7%, respectively) was higher than those in the
      control animals. Taken together, the results obtained herein indicate that
      inclusion of WSAE in diets of L. vannamei effectively enhanced the growth,
      antioxidant biomarkers, immune response, and resistance to the V. harveyi
      infection, particularly at the treatment of 2.0g/kg feed.

TI  - A comprehensive review of heavy metal pollution in the coastal areas of
      Bangladesh: abundance, bioaccumulation, health implications, and challenges.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-22122-9 [doi]
AB  - The coastal zone of Bangladesh, with a population density of 1278 people per
      square kilometer, is under serious threat due to heavy metal pollution. To date, 
      many studies have been conducted on the heavy metal contamination in soils,
      water, aquatic animals, and plants in the coastal zone of Bangladesh; however,
      the available information is dispersed. In this study, previous findings on the
      contamination levels, distributions, risks, and sources of heavy metals in
      sediments and organisms were summarized for the first time to present the overall
      status of heavy metal pollution along coastal regions. Earlier research found
      that the concentrations of various heavy metals (HMs), particularly Co, Cd, Pb,
      Cu, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni in water, sediment, and fish in most coastal locations,
      were above their permissible limits. High concentrations of HMs were observed in 
      sediments and water, like Cr of 55 mg/kg and 86.93 mg/l in the ship-breaking
      areas and Karnaphuli River, respectively, in coastal regions of Bangladesh. Heavy
      metals severely contaminated the Karnaphuli River estuary and ship-breaking area 
      on the Sitakundu coast, where sediments were the ultimate sink of high
      concentrations of metals. Sedentary or bottom-dwelling organisms like gastropods 
      and shrimp had higher levels of heavy metals than other organisms. As a result,
      the modified PRISMA review method was used to look at the critical research gap
      about heavy metal pollution in Bangladesh's coastal areas by analyzing the
      current research trends and bottlenecks.

TI  - Acute ammonia stress-induced oxidative and heat shock responses modulated by
      transcription factors in Litopenaeus vannamei.

LID - 10.1016/j.fsi.2022.07.060 [doi]
AB  - The present study aimed to examine the effects of short-term exposure to ammonia 
      on stress and oxidative responses in shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) and to
      determine whether the antioxidant system related to the regulatory role of
      transcription factors and stress proteins was activated. Shrimp were exposed
      ammonia-N at four concentrations: 0 (control), 5, 10, and 15mg/L, for 48h. The
      hepatopancreas was sampled to measure the levels of glutathione (GSH),
      malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO); the activities of superoxide dismutase 
      (SOD), catalase (CAT), nitric oxide synthase (NOS); and the expression levels of 
      GSH-px (encoding glutathione peroxidase), GST (encoding
      glutathione-S-transferase), HSP70 (encoding heat shock protein 70), HSP90
      (encoding heat shock protein 90), p53, RELISH, and AKIRIN. We observed that
      exposure to a high ammonia content increased the abundance of oxidative factors
      (MDA, CAT, SOD, NOS, and NO), reduced the levels of GSH, and upregulated the mRNA
      expression levels of antioxidant genes (GSH-px and GST), stress-related genes
      (HSP70 and HSP90), and transcription factor genes (p53, RELISH, and AKIRIN).
      These results indicated that ammonia induced oxidative stress and in fl ammation.
      Both enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant defense systems are involved, which
      might be regulated by HSPs, as well as certain transcription factors, such as p53
      and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), thus mounting an adaptive response to
      help rebalance redox homoeostasis.

      expressing VP15 against WSSV.
LID - S1050-4648(22)00432-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.fsi.2022.07.043 [doi]
AB  - White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is one of the most concerning pathogens in
      penaeid shrimp and can cause severe loss in shrimp aquaculture worldwide. Among
      the WSSV structural proteins, VP15, a DNA-binding protein located in the WSSV
      nucleocapsid, is an antiviral protein candidate to protect kuruma shrimp
      (Marsupenaeus japonicus) from WSSV infection. We identified that the truncated
      VP15, VP15(26-57), is responsible for the protective effect against the WSSV.
      This study attempts to develop an immunizing agent against WSSV using silkworm
      pupa as a delivery vector through oral administration. The VP15, VP15(26-57), and
      SR11 peptide derived from VP15(26-57) were expressed in silkworm pupae. Oral
      administration of feed mixed with the powdered pupae that expressed VP15-derived 
      constructs enhanced the survivability of kuruma shrimp with an overall relative
      percent survival (RPS) higher than 70%. There is no death for the group receiving
      pupa/VP15(26-57), and the RPS is 100%. In addition, we also investigated the
      relative mRNA expression levels of immune-related genes by qPCR at different time
      points. Our results indicate that the oral administration of pupa/VP15-derived
      products could provide a high protective effect against WSSV and be a practical
      approach for controlling WSSV in aquaculture.

AB  - White spot disease (WSD) has posed a serious threat to the China and the global
      shrimp aquaculture. In order to diagnose white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) early
      and prevent the spread and outbreak of WSD, it is necessary to establish a highly

      a pre-amplification qPCR assay from the crude extract of samples heated lysis was
      established, which was further compared with the universal qPCR assay to verify
      the shrimp samples. The limit of detection (LOD) of pre-amplification qPCR assay 
      and universal qPCR assay was 2.80 copies and 20.57 copies per reaction at 95% CI,
      respectively. It had good WSSV specificity and did not show cross-detection of
      infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV), hepatopancreatic 
      parvovirus (HPV), Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP), acute hepatopancreas
      necrosis disease (AHPND), necrotizing hepatopancreatitis bacteria (NHPB), and
      decapod iridescent virus 1 (DIV1). A total of 36 shrimp samples were detected as 
      WSSV DNA positive by pre-amplification qPCR with crude extract from samples
      heated lysis and universal qPCR with DNA extraction. The diagnostic sensitivity
      and specificity were 97.22% (85.5 ~ 99.9%, 95% CI) and 100% (81.5 ~ 100%, 95%
      CI), respectively. The agreement Kappa value was 0.959 (0.879 ~ 1, 95% CI), and
      the analysis results were basically consistent. Eliminating the tedious steps of 
      extracting DNA and using pre-amplified qPCR to detect WSSV in shrimp, it is a
      good choice for aquaculture farms. Graphical abstract: Supplementary Information:

AB  - The white spot syndrome virus is the most destructive virus threatening the
      shrimp industry worldwide, causing hundreds of millions of dollars in economic
      losses each year. There is currently no specific medicine to treat it. Therefore,
      rapid and accurate detection of WSSV is of great significance for controlling its
      spread and reducing economic losses. Traditional detection methods, such as
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantitative fluorescent PCR, rely on
      laboratory equipment and are not suitable for field testing. In this study,
      recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) combined with a lateral flow strip
      (LFS) was developed. This method targets the entire genome and designs primers
      and probes accordingly. The detection can be completed in 30 min at 37 degrees C,
      and the detection limit of each reaction is 20 copies, which is much more
      sensitive than other detection methods. The RPA-LFS method is highly specific to 
      the white spot syndrome virus and has no cross-reactivity with other common
      shrimp viruses or pathogens. In total, 100 field samples were tested and compared
      to the real-time PCR method. Both methods detected 8 positive results, and the
      positive detection rate was 100%. The method was fast, simple, specific, and
      sensitive. It does not rely on laboratory equipment and has broad application
      prospects for in-field detection, especially in remote areas with underdeveloped 
      medical equipment.

AB  - Neonicotinoids are widely used insecticides around the world and are preserved
      permanently in soils and appear in surface waters posing an increased threat to
      ecosystems. In the present study, we exposed adult specimens of amphipod
      Dikerogammarus villosus to environmentally relevant and higher concentrations of 
      two widely used agricultural neonicotinoids, clothianidin (CLO) and imidacloprid 
      (IMI), for 2days. The acute effects were investigated at the behavioral
      (immobility time and swimming activity) and biochemical (glutathione
      S-transferase [GST] and acetylcholine esterase [AchE] activity) levels. All CLO
      concentrations used (64nM, 128nM, 192nM) significantly decreased the immobility
      time and swimming activity. In the case of IMI, the immobility time decreased
      significantly only at the highest concentration applied (977nM), but the distance
      travelled by the animals significantly decreased even at lower concentrations
      (78nM and 313nM). The GST enzyme activity did not change in the CLO-treated
      groups, however, the 626nM and 977nM IMI concentrations significantly increased
      the GST activity. Similarly, to the behavioral level, all CLO concentrations
      significantly decreased the AchE activity. In contrast, IMI has a significant
      stimulating effect on the AchE activity at the 313nM, 626nM, and 977nM
      concentrations. Based on the authors' best knowledge, this is the first study to 
      investigate the effects of CLO and IMI at environmentally-relevant concentrations
      on D. villosus. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the physiological
      effects of neonicotinoids.

AB  - We aimed to prepare a new pH-sensing film based on the immobilization of purple
      cabbage anthocyanins (PCA) into Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) reinforced by cellulose
      nanocrystals (CNC). FT-IR, XRD and TGA were used to assess the intermolecular
      interactions and thermo-stability of films. The addition of CNC and PCA resulted 
      in an enhancement in UV-vis barrier, mechanical properties and moisture
      resistance. Inclusion of PCA imparted intelligent properties to the films.
      PCA-loaded films displayed strong visually detectable colorimetric responses to
      pH (2-13) and volatile ammonia. When applied to monitor shrimp freshness at 4
      degrees C, PVA/CNC films containing 0.6 % PCA exhibited conspicuous color
      fluctuations from purple to gray blue upon deterioration. As a result,
      PVA/CNC-PCA colorimetric films were considered as intelligent packaging labels
      with significant mechanical, water vapor barrier properties and pH-sensing
      qualities for visual quality evaluation of fresh seafood products.

AB  - We report K-Pg-age deposits in Baja California, Mexico, consisting of terrestrial
      and shallow-marine materials re-sedimented onto the continental slope, including 
      corals, gastropods, bivalves, shocked quartz grains, an andesitic tuff with a
      SHRIMP U-Pb age (66.12 +/- 0.65 Ma) indistinguishable from that of the K-Pg
      boundary, and charred tree trunks. The overlying mudstones show an iridium
      anomaly and fungal and fern spores spikes. We interpret these heterogeneous
      deposits as a direct result of the Chicxulub impact and a mega-tsunami in
      response to seismically-induced landsliding. The tsunami backwash carried the
      megaflora offshore in high-density flows, remobilizing shallow-marine fauna and
      sediment en route. Charring of the trees at temperatures up to > 1000 degrees C
      took place in the interval between impact and arrival of the tsunami, which on
      the basis of seismic velocities and historic analogues amounted to only tens of
      minutes at most. This constrains the timing and causes of fires and the minimum
      distance from the impact site over which fires may be ignited.

TI  - The Origin of Asexual Brine Shrimps.
PG  - E52-E76
LID - 10.1086/720268 [doi]
AB  - AbstractDetermining how and how often asexual lineages emerge within sexual
      species is central to our understanding of sex-asex transitions and the long-term
      maintenance of sex. Asexuality can arise "by transmission" from an existing
      asexual lineage to a new one through different types of crosses. The occurrence
      of these crosses, cryptic sex, variations in ploidy, and recombination within
      asexuals greatly complicates the study of sex-asex transitions, as they preclude 
      the use of standard phylogenetic methods and genetic distance metrics. In this
      study we show how to overcome these challenges by developing new approaches to
      investigate the origin of the various asexual lineages of the brine shrimp
      Artemia parthenogenetica. We use a large sample of asexuals, including all known 
      polyploids, and their sexual relatives. We combine flow cytometry with
      mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data. We develop new genetic distance measures and 
      methods to compare various scenarios describing the origin of the different
      lineages. We find that all diploid and polyploid A. parthenogenetica likely arose
      within the past 80,000 years through successive and nested hybridization events
      that involved backcrosses with different sexual species. All A. parthenogenetica 
      have the same common ancestor and therefore likely carry the same asexuality
      gene(s) and reproduce by automixis. These findings radically change our view of
      sex-asex transitions in this group and show the importance of considering
      scenarios of asexuality by transmission. The methods developed are applicable to 
      many other asexual taxa.

TI  - Biological sensitivities to high-resolution climate change projections in the
      California current marine ecosystem.
LID - 10.1111/gcb.16317 [doi]
AB  - The California Current Marine Ecosystem is a highly productive system that
      exhibits strong natural variability and vulnerability to anthropogenic climate
      trends. Relating projections of ocean change to biological sensitivities requires
      detailed synthesis of experimental results. Here, we combine measured biological 
      sensitivities with high-resolution climate projections of key variables
      (temperature, oxygen, and pCO2 ) to identify the direction, magnitude, and
      spatial distribution of organism-scale vulnerabilities to multiple axes of
      projected ocean change. Among 12 selected species of cultural and economic
      importance, we find that all are sensitive to projected changes in ocean
      conditions through responses that affect individual performance or population
      processes. Response indices were largest in the northern region and inner shelf. 
      While performance traits generally increased with projected changes, fitness
      traits generally decreased, indicating that concurrent stresses can lead to
      fitness loss. For two species, combining sensitivities to temperature and oxygen 
      changes through the Metabolic Index shows how aerobic habitat availability could 
      be compressed under future conditions. Our results suggest substantial and
      specific ecological susceptibility in the next 80 years, including potential
      regional loss of canopy-forming kelp, changes in nearshore food webs caused by
      declining rates of survival among red urchins, Dungeness crab, and razor clams,
      and loss of aerobic habitat for anchovy and pink shrimp. We also highlight
      fillable gaps in knowledge, including specific physiological responses to
      stressors, variation in responses across life stages, and responses to
      multistressor combinations. These findings strengthen the case for filling
      information gaps with experiments focused on fitness-related responses and those 
      that can be used to parameterize integrative physiological models, and suggest
      that the CCME is susceptible to substantial changes to ecosystem structure and
      function within this century.

TI  - Mechano-Enzymatic Degradation of the Chitin from Crustacea Shells for Efficient
      Production of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc).
LID - 4720 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27154720 [doi]
AB  - Chitin, the second richest polymer in nature, is composed of the monomer
      N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), which has numerous functions and is widely applied 
      in the medical, food, and chemical industries. However, due to the highly
      crystalline configuration and low accessibility in water of the chitin resources,
      such as shrimp and crab shells, the chitin is difficult utilize, and the
      traditional chemical method causes serious environment pollution and a waste of
      resources. In the present study, three genes encoding chitinolytic enzymes,
      including the N-acetylglucosaminidase from Ostrinia furnacalis (OfHex1),
      endo-chitinase from Trichoderma viride (TvChi1), and multifunctional chitinase
      from Chitinolyticbacter meiyuanensis (CmChi1), were expressed in the Pichia
      pastoris system, and the positive transformants with multiple copies were
      isolated by the PTVA (post-transformational vector amplification) method,
      respectively. The three recombinants OfHex1, TvChi1, and CmChi1 were induced by
      methanol and purified by the chitin affinity adsorption method. The purified
      recombinants OfHex1 and TvChi1 were characterized, and they were further used
      together for degrading chitin from shrimp and crab shells to produce GlcNAc
      through liquid-assisted grinding (LAG) under a water-less condition. The
      substrate chitin concentration reached up to 300 g/L, and the highest yield of
      the product GlcNAc reached up to 61.3 g/L using the mechano-enzymatic method. A
      yield rate of up to 102.2 g GlcNAc per 1 g enzyme was obtained.

TI  - Comparative Transcriptome Analysis Reveals That WSSV IE1 Protein Plays a Crucial 
      Role in DNA Replication Control.
LID - 8176 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23158176 [doi]
AB  - For DNA viruses, the immediate-early (IE) proteins are generally essential
      regulators that manipulate the host machinery to support viral replication.
      Recently, IE1, an IE protein encoded by white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), has
      been demonstrated to function as a transcription factor. However, the target
      genes of IE1 during viral infection remain poorly understood. Here, we explored
      the host target genes of IE1 using RNAi coupled with transcriptome sequencing
      analysis. A total of 429 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified
      from penaeid shrimp, of which 284 genes were upregulated and 145 genes were
      downregulated after IE1 knockdown. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis
      revealed the identified DEGs are significantly enriched in the minichromosome
      maintenance (MCM) complex and DNA replication, indicating that IE1 plays a
      critical role in DNA replication control. In addition, it was found that Penaeus 
      vannamei MCM complex genes were remarkably upregulated after WSSV infection,
      while RNAi-mediated knockdown of PvMCM2 reduced the expression of viral genes and
      viral loads at the early infection stage. Finally, we demonstrated that
      overexpression of IE1 promoted the expression of MCM complex genes as well as
      cellular DNA synthesis in insect High-Five cells. Collectively, our current data 
      suggest that the WSSV IE1 protein is a viral effector that modulates the host DNA
      replication machinery for viral replication.

AB  - Vibrio fluvialis is an opportunistic waterborne and seafood-borne enteric
      pathogen capable of causing severe diarrhea leading to death. This pathogen is
      endemic to Bangladesh, a country which is a major producer of cultured shrimp and
      wild-caught prawns. In this study, we carried out whole-genome sequencing of
      three V. fluvialis organisms isolated from shrimp farm and river sediment showing
      strong pathogenic characteristics in vivo and in vitro and compared their genomes
      against other V. fluvialis and related pathogenic species to glean insights into 
      their potential as pathogens. Numerous virulence-associated genes including
      hemolysins, cytolysins, three separate Type IV pili, Types II and VI secretion
      systems, biofilm, and the V. cholerae pathogenesis regulating gene, toxR, were
      identified. Moreover, we found strain S-10 to have the propensity to acquire
      antibiotic resistance genes through horizontal gene transfer. These findings
      indicate that shrimp farms and rivers could be potential sources of V. fluvialis 
      organisms which are an infection threat of public health concern.

TI  - Isolation and Characterization of a Lytic Vibrio parahaemolyticus Phage
      vB_VpaP_GHSM17 from Sewage Samples.
LID - 1601 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14081601 [doi]
AB  - Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a major foodborne pathogen and the main cause of
      diarrheal diseases transmitted by seafood such as fish, shrimp, and shellfish. In
      the current study, a novel lytic phage infecting V. parahaemolyticus,
      vB_VpaP_GHSM17, was isolated from the sewage of a seafood market, Huangsha,
      Guangzhou, and its morphology, biochemistry, and taxonomy features were
      identified. Morphological observation revealed that GHSM17 had an icosahedral
      head with a short, non-contractile tail. The double-stranded DNA genome of GHSM17
      consisted of 43,228 bp with a GC content of 49.42%. In total, 45 putative ORFs
      were identified in the GHSM17 genome. Taxonomic analysis indicated GHSM17
      belonging to genus Maculvirus, family Autographiviridae. In addition, GHSM17 was 
      stable over a wide range of temperatures (20-60 degrees C) and pH (5-11) and was 
      completely inactivated after 70 min of ultraviolet irradiation. The bacterial
      inhibition assay revealed that GHSM17 could inhibit the growth of V.
      parahaemolyticus within 8 h. The results support that phage GHSM17 may be a
      potential candidate in the biological control of V. parahaemolyticus
      contamination in aquaculture.

TI  - Development of Fermented Shrimp Shell Product with Hypoglycemic and Hypolipidemic
      Effects on Diabetic Rats.
LID - 695 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/metabo12080695 [doi]
AB  - In 2020, approximately 9.3 billion tons of crustaceans were consumed, and 45-48% 
      of shrimp shell (SS) by-products were discarded as waste. In this study, the SS
      of Litopenaeus vannamei was fermented by Lactobacillus plantarum LV33204,
      Stenotrophomonas maltophilia LV2122 (strong proteolytic activity), and Aeromonas 
      dhakensis LV1111 (chitin-degrading activity), and the optimal fermentation
      conditions of liquid-fermented SS was established. Contents of total peptide,
      astaxanthin, and total phenolic content of the fermented SS were significantly
      higher than that of unfermented SS. In the presence of fermented SS, glucose
      uptake and insulin resistance of TNF-alpha-stimulated FL83B hepatocytes were
      markedly improved. Furthermore, daily oral supplement of fermented SS to
      streptozotocin (STZ)/nicotinamide (NA)-induced diabetic rats for 7 weeks
      significantly reduced plasma glucose and insulin resistance. Meanwhile, ingestion
      of fermented SS might enhance hepatic catabolism of glucose by increasing
      hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity and decreasing
      glucose-6-phosphatase activity. In addition, the fermented SS downregulated
      plasma total cholesterol (TG), triglycerides (TCs), low-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (LDL-C), liver TG, and TC and lipid peroxidation levels in diabetic
      rats. In conclusion, a biorefinery process for waste SS was established through
      mixed strain fermentation. The in vitro and in vivo data reveal that the
      fermented SS is a promising functional food for the management of diabetic
      hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia.

TI  - Depolymerized Fractions of Sulfated Galactans Extracted from Gracilaria fisheri
      and Their Antibacterial Activity against Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio
      harveyi.
LID - 469 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/md20080469 [doi]
AB  - Various seaweed sulfated polysaccharides have been explored for antimicrobial
      application. This study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial activity of the
      native Gracilaria fisheri sulfated galactans (NSG) and depolymerized fractions
      against the marine pathogenic bacteria Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio
      harveyi. NSG was hydrolyzed in different concentrations of H2O2 to generate
      sulfated galactans degraded fractions (SGF). The molecular weight, structural
      characteristics, and physicochemical parameters of both NSG and SGF were
      determined. The results revealed that the high molecular weight NSG (228.33 kDa) 
      was significantly degraded to SGFs of 115.76, 3.79, and 3.19 kDa by hydrolysis
      with 0.4, 2, and 10% H2O2, respectively. The Fourier transformed spectroscopy
      (FTIR) and (1)H- and (13)C-Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses demonstrated
      that the polysaccharide chain structure of SGFs was not affected by H2O2
      degradation, but alterations were detected at the peak positions of some
      functional groups. In vitro study showed that SGFs significantly exerted a
      stronger antibacterial activity against V. parahaemolyticus and V. harveyi than
      NSG, which might be due to the low molecular weight and higher sulfation
      properties of SGF. SGF disrupted the bacterial cell membrane, resulting in
      leakage of intracellular biological components, and subsequently, cell death.
      Taken together, this study provides a basis for the exploitation and utilization 
      of low-molecular-weight sulfated galactans from G. fisheri to prevent and control
      the shrimp pathogens.

TI  - Development of a Novel RT-qPCR Detecting Method of Covert Mortality Nodavirus
      (CMNV) for the National Proficiency Test in Molecular Detection.
LID - 1475 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071475 [doi]
AB  - Covert mortality nodavirus (CMNV), the pathogen of viral covert mortality disease
      (VCMD), has caused serious economic losses of shrimp aquaculture in Southeast
      Asian countries and China in the past decade. In view of that the rapid and
      accurate laboratory detection of CMNV plays a major role in the effective control
      of the spread of VCMD. The national proficiency test (NPT) for the detection of
      covert mortality nodavirus (CMNV) started in China from 2021. In this study, a
      novel TaqMan real-time reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) detection
      method for CMNV with higher sensitivity than previous reports was established
      based on specific primers and probe designing from the conserved regions of the
      CMNV coat protein gene for using molecular detection of CMNV in NPT. The
      optimized RT-qPCR reaction program was determined as reverse transcription at
      54.9 degrees C for 15 min and denaturation at 95 degrees C for 1 min, followed by
      40 cycles including denaturation at 95 degrees C for 10 s, and annealing and
      extension at 54.9 degrees C for 25 s. The detection limit of the newly developed 
      RT-qPCR method was determined to be as low as 2.15 copies of CMNV plasmids
      template per reaction, with the correlation coefficient (R(2)) at above 0.99. The
      new method showed no cross reaction with the six common aquatic animal pathogens 
      and could be finished in one hour, which represents a rapid detection method that
      can save 50% detection time versus the previously reported assay. The CMNV TaqMan
      probe based RT-qPCR method developed in present study supplies a novel sensitive 
      and specific tool for both the rapid diagnosing and quantitating of CMNV in NPT
      activities and in the farmed crustaceans, and will help practitioners in the
      aquaculture industry to prevent and control VCMD effectively.

TI  - Applying Modified VP53A Recombinant Protein as an Anti-White Spot Syndrome Virus 
      Biological Agent in Litopenaeus vannamei Farming.
LID - 1353 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071353 [doi]
AB  - Shrimp farming is an important economic activity. However, due to the spread of
      pathogens, shrimp aquaculture is becoming increasingly difficult. Many studies
      have confirmed that white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) recombinant proteins can
      inhibit viral infection. Among them, VP53 recombinant protein has been found to
      reduce mortality upon WSSV challenge. This study was conducted in Kaohsiung,
      Taiwan and reports the first field feeding trial to demonstrate that WSSV
      recombinant proteins can improve shrimp survival rates at a farming scale. Prior 
      to the feeding trial, the shrimp were confirmed to be slightly infected with
      WSSV, Vibrio parahaemolyticus strains causing acute hepatopancreatic necrosis
      disease (AHPND), non-AHPND V. parahaemolyticus strains, and Enterocytozoon
      hepatopenaei (EHP), which are common pathogens that shrimp farmers often face.
      The shrimp were then divided into two groups: a control group (C group) fed with 
      a commercial diet and a protein group (P group) fed with the same commercial feed
      with VP53 recombinant protein. Our findings indicated that the survival rate and 
      expression of immune genes of the P group were higher than those of the C group. 
      The intestinal microbiota of the two groups were also analysed. Collectively, our
      results confirmed that the recombinant WSSV envelope protein derivative can be
      used as an effective anti-virus biological agent in shrimp farms.

TI  - Biological Activities of Seven Medicinal Plants Used in Chiapas, Mexico.
LID - 1790 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/plants11141790 [doi]
AB  - Seven medicinal plants from Chiapas, Mexico, used by Native Americans were
      analyzed, aiming to improve the understanding of their medicinal properties
      through the evaluation of various biological activities, i.e., bactericidal,
      antioxidant, alpha-glucosidase inhibition, and toxicity, to provide a scientific 
      basis for the management of infectious and hyperglycemic diseases in the Mexican 
      southeast. Plant extracts were obtained from Cordia dodecandra, Gaultheria
      odorata, Heliotropium angiospermum, Justicia spicigera, Leucaena collinsii spp.
      collinsii, Tagetes nelsonii, and Talisia oliviformis through maceration
      techniques using methanol and chloroform (1:1). Minimum Inhibitory Concentration 
      (MIC) was employed to determine the antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus
      aureus, Enterobacter faecalis, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes,
      Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeuroginosa. The
      antiradical/antioxidant activity was determined by the
      2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH),
      2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) assays and
      antihemolytic activity using the 2,2'-Azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride
      radical (APPH). The anti-alpha-glucosidase activity was evaluated in vitro
      through the chromogenic PNPG assay. The toxicity was assessed using the brine
      shrimp lethality assay. The highest antimicrobial activity was displayed by T.
      nelsonii, mainly against E. faecalis and P. aeuroginosa. The extracts of L.
      collinsii, J. spicigera, and T. nelsonii possess antioxidant properties with EC50
      &lt; 50 mug/mL. J. spicigera and T. nelsonii extracts showed the highest
      antihemolytic activity with IC50 &lt; 14 mug/mL. T. nelsonii exhibited a
      remarkable inhibitor effect on the alpha-glucosidase enzyme and the greatest
      toxic effect on Artemia salina with IC50 = 193 +/- 20 mug/mL and LD50 = 14 +/- 1 
      mug/mL, respectively. According to our results, G. odorata, J. spicigera, T.
      nelsonii, and T. oliviformis extracts contained active antimicrobial compounds.
      At the same time, T. nelsonii stands to be a possible source of effective
      antineoplastic and antihyperglycemic compounds.

TI  - Salpianthus macrodontus Extracts, a Novel Source of Phenolic Compounds with
      Antibacterial Activity against Potentially Pathogenic Bacteria Isolated from
      White Shrimp.
LID - 4397 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27144397 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial activity in vitro of Salpianthus
      macrodontus and Azadirachta indica extracts against potentially pathogenic
      bacteria for Pacific white shrimp. Furthermore, the extracts with higher
      inhibitory activity were analyzed to identify compounds responsible for bacterial
      inhibition and evaluate their effect on motility and biofilm formation. S.
      macrodontus and A. indica extracts were prepared using methanol, acetone, and
      hexane by ultrasound. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the extracts 
      was determined against Vibrio parahaemolyticus, V. harveyi, Photobacterium
      damselae and P. leiognathi. The polyphenol profile of those extracts showing the 
      highest bacterial inhibition were determined. Besides, the bacterial swimming and
      swarming motility and biofilm formation were determined. The highest inhibitory
      activity against the four pathogens was found with the acetonic extract of S.
      macrodontus leaf (MIC of 50 mg/mL for Vibrio spp. and 25 mg/mL for Photobacterium
      spp.) and the methanol extract of S. macrodontus flower (MIC of 50 mg/mL for all 
      pathogens tested). Both extracts affected the swarming and swimming motility and 
      the biofilm formation of the tested bacteria. The main phenolic compounds related
      to Vibrio bacteria inhibition were naringin, vanillic acid, and rosmarinic acid, 
      whilst hesperidin, kaempferol pentosyl-rutinoside, and rhamnetin were related to 
      Photobacterium bacteria inhibition.

TI  - Effects of Nano-Aerators on Microbial Communities and Functions in the Water,
      Sediment, and Shrimp Intestine in Litopenaeus vannamei Aquaculture Ponds.
LID - 1302 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10071302 [doi]
AB  - Nanobubble technology has promising development and application prospects in the 
      fields of sewage treatment, soil and groundwater remediation, animal and plant
      growth, and biomedicine. However, few studies have investigated its effect on
      shrimp aquaculture. In this study, we investigated the effect of nano-aerators on
      microbial communities of the water, sediment, and shrimp gut in a Litopenaeus
      vannamei aquaculture pond using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing. The results 
      indicated that the nano-aerator significantly increased the microbial community
      diversity and species abundance in the pond, and the microbial community
      diversity of the pond sediment increased under short-term aeration conditions.
      Compared to that with ordinary aerators, nano-aerators increased the proportion
      of beneficial bacteria, such as Exiguobacterium and Acinetobacter, in the water
      and sediment microbial communities. Moreover, the proportions of beneficial
      bacteria in the gut, including Rhodobacter, Oscillospira, and Faecalibacterium,
      were all increased by using the nano-aerator. Therefore, our findings suggest
      that nano-aerators could promote the activity of beneficial bacteria in
      aquaculture ecosystems, thereby regulating water quality, reducing disease
      incidence, and improving aquaculture efficiency and benefits. Our findings
      provide new insights into the effects of nano-aerators on microbes in crustacean 
      culture ponds.

TI  - Genetic Demography of the Blue and Red Shrimp, Aristeus antennatus: A
      Female-Based Case Study Integrating Multilocus Genotyping and Morphometric Data.
LID - 1186 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13071186 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we quantified the three key biological processes, growth,
      recruitment, and dispersal pattern, which are necessary for a better
      understanding of the population dynamics of the blue and red shrimp Aristeus
      antennatus. This marine exploited crustacean shows sex-related distribution along
      the water column, being females predominate in the middle slope. The present
      study attempts to fill the existing gap in the females' genetic demography, as
      scarce knowledge is available despite being the most abundant sex in catches. We 
      analyzed morphometric data and genotyped 12 microsatellite loci in 665
      A.&amp;nbsp;antennatus females collected in two consecutive seasons, winter and
      summer 2016, at the main Mediterranean fishing ground as a model. Almost every
      female in summer was inseminated. Five modal groups were observed in both
      seasons, from 0+ to 4+ in winter and from 1+ to 5+ in summer. Commercial-sized
      sorting based on fishermen's experience resulted in a moderate-to-high assertive 
      method concerning cohort determination. Genetic data pointed out females'
      horizontal movement between neighboring fishing grounds, explaining the low
      genetic divergence detected among western Mediterranean grounds. Our results
      could represent critical information for the future implementation of management 
      measures to ensure long-time conservation of the A.&amp;nbsp;antennatus
      populations.

TI  - Astaxanthin Extract from Shrimp (Trachypenaeus curvirostris) By-Products Improves
      Quality of Ready-to-Cook Shrimp Surimi Products during Frozen Storage at -18
      degrees C.

LID - 10.3390/foods11142122 [doi]
AB  - The effects of astaxanthin extract (AE) from shrimp by-products on the quality
      and sensory properties of ready-to-cook shrimp surimi products (RC-SSP) during
      frozen storage at -18 degrees C were investigated. Changes in 2-thiobarbituric
      acid reactive substances (TBARS) value, sulfhydryl groups, carbonyls,
      salt-soluble protein content, textural properties, color, and sensory quality
      over specific storage days were evaluated. The AE from shrimp by-products
      contained 4.49 mug/g tocopherol and 23.23 mug/g astaxanthin. The shrimp surimi
      products supplemented with 30 g/kg AE had higher redness values and greater
      overall acceptability and texture properties after cooking (p &lt; 0.05). AE
      showed higher oxidative stability in RC-SSP than the control, as evidenced by
      lower TBARS and carbonyl content, and higher sulfhydryl and salt-soluble protein 
      content. AE from shrimp by-products had positive effects on the antioxidant
      activity and color difference of RC-SSP, and could be used as a potential
      multifunctional additive for the development of shrimp surimi products.

TI  - Improvement of Pacific White Shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) Drying Characteristics
      and Quality Attributes by a Combination of Salting Pretreatment and Microwave.
LID - 2066 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/foods11142066 [doi]
AB  - This study investigated the effects of salting pretreatment and microwave (MW)
      power on drying characteristics, water distribution and quality attributes of
      Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). With increasing salt concentration
      (0-8%, w/v) and MW power (300-900 W), the drying time of shrimp was shortened by 
      15.15-28.57%, compared with the untreated samples. Regarding the quality of dried
      shrimp, increasing the salt concentration and MW power increased the hardness
      (from 13,073.6 to 24,556.5 g), while the springiness, color parameters and
      astaxanthin content showed an initial decrease but a later increase trend. Low
      field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) demonstrated that the T2 curve of the
      pretreated samples moved toward the negative x-axis and the immobilized water
      content decreased with increasing salt concentration. E-nose showed that volatile
      components were different and could be obviously distinguished at different salt 
      concentrations and MW powers. Raman spectroscopy illustrated that the protein
      secondary structure of dried shrimp was altered by salting pretreatment and
      drying conditions, and the lowest conversion degree of alpha-helix to beta-sheet 
      of dried shrimp was obtained at the salt concentration of 4% (w/v) and MW power
      of 500 W. By comprehensively considering the drying time and quality attributes, 
      the combination of 4% (w/v) salt and 500 W MW power was concluded as the best
      drying conditions for shrimp using a microwave. The results could provide an
      innovative combination of salt pretreatment and MW drying with suitable
      processing conditions for producing high-quality dried shrimp.

TI  - Efficacy of 405 nm Light-Emitting Diode Illumination and Citral Used Alone and in
      Combination for Inactivation of Vibrio parahaemolyticus on Shrimp.
LID - 2008 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/foods11142008 [doi]
AB  - Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a widely distributed pathogen, which is frequently the
      lead cause of infections related to seafood consumption. The objective of the
      present study was to investigate the antimicrobial effect of the combination of
      405 nm light-emitting diode (LED) and citral on V. parahaemolyticus. The
      antimicrobial effect of LED illumination and citral was evaluated on V.
      parahaemolyticus not only in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) but also on shrimp. 
      Quality changes of shrimp were determined by sensory evaluation. Changes in
      bacteria cell membrane morphology, cell membrane permeability, cell lipid
      oxidation level, and DNA degradation were examined to provide insights into the
      antimicrobial mechanism. The combination of LED treatments and citral had better 
      antimicrobial effects than either treatment alone. LED combined with 0.1 mg/mL of
      citral effectively reduced V. parahaemolyticus from 6.5 log CFU/mL to below the
      detection limit in PBS. Combined treatment caused a 3.5 log reduction of the
      pathogen on shrimp within 20 min and a 6 log reduction within 2 h without
      significant changes in the sensory score. Furthermore, combined LED and citral
      treatment affected V. parahaemolyticus cellular morphology and outer membrane
      integrity. The profile of the comet assay and DNA fragmentation analysis revealed
      that combination treatment did not cause a breakdown of bacterial genomic DNA. In
      conclusion, LED may act synergistically with citral. They have the potential to
      be developed as novel microbial intervention strategies.

TI  - A Rapid Tricolour Immunochromatographic Assay for Simultaneous Detection of
      Tricaine and Malachite Green.
LID - 456 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/bios12070456 [doi]
AB  - In this research, we designed a rapid tricolour immunochromatographic test strip 
      with double test lines (TS-DTL) and two-colour AuNP probes, which realised the
      simultaneous detection of tricaine mesylate (TMS) and malachite green (MG).
      Through a distinct tricolour system (red T1 line, blue T2 line and purple C
      line), a visual identification of TMS (0.2 mug/mL) and MG (0.5 mug/mL) was
      quickly achieved on site, which improved the accuracy of naked eye observations. 
      The LODs of TMS in aquaculture water, fish and shrimp were 11.0, 29.6 and 61.4
      ng/mL, respectively. MG LODs were 47.0 ng/mL (aquaculture water), 82.8 ng/mL
      (fish) and 152.4 ng/mL (shrimp). The LOD of MG was close to the similar TS
      methods. However, visual detection of TMS could meet the requirements of the
      residue limit (1 mug/mL) of TMS in the USA, and the quantitative detection of TMS
      was over 16 times lower than the USA standard. The developed platform was rapid
      (~20 min, HPLC~3 h) and accurate, which was verified using a traditional HPLC
      method. The recovery rates ranged from 82.2% to 108.6% in three types of real
      samples, indicating a potential application in on-site fast screening or multiple
      detection for TMS and MG residues in aquatic products.

TI  - A Dynamic Energy Budget Model for Kuruma Shrimp Penaeus japonicus:
      Parameterization and Application in Integrated Marine Pond Aquaculture.
LID - 1828 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12141828 [doi]
AB  - Individual growth models can form the basis of population dynamics assessment and
      ecosystem model construction. In order to provide a basic module for an ecosystem
      model of an integrated marine aquaculture pond, an individual growth model was
      constructed for kuruma shrimp (Penaeus japonicus) based on dynamic energy budget 
      (DEB) theory. The model was first parameterized based on a covariation method
      using the Add-my-Pet (AmP) procedure. The parametric estimation model
      underestimated the ultimate abdominal length for female shrimp, and the predicted
      values of other zero-variate parameters were generally consistent with observed
      values. The relative errors of the predicted and observed values of the
      univariate data set within three geographical regions showed acceptable goodness 
      of fit. Parameter estimation achieved an overall goodness of fit with a mean
      relative error of 0.048 and a symmetric mean squared error of 0.066. A DEB model 
      was constructed using the estimated parameters, and the goodness-of-fit
      indicators (R square, mean bias and absolute and relative root mean square error)
      showed that the model was able to reproduce the growth of kuruma shrimp in terms 
      of total length and wet weight with high accuracy. The results provide data to
      support the subsequent development of integrated aquaculture management at the
      ecosystem level.

AB  - Objective: To establish an ultra-sensitive, ultra-fast, visible detection method 
      for Vibrio parahaemolyticus (VP) . Methods: We established a new method for
      detecting the tdh and trh genes of VP using clustered regularly interspaced short
      palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 12a (CRISPR/Cas12a) combined with
      recombinase polymerase amplification and visual detection (CRISPR/Cas12a-VD).
      Results: CRISPR/Cas12a-VD accurately detected target DNA at concentrations as low
      as 10 (-18) M (single molecule detection) within 30 min without cross-reactivity 
      against other bacteria. When detecting pure cultures of VP, the consistency of
      results reached 100% compared with real-time PCR. The method accurately analysed 
      pure cultures and spiked shrimp samples at concentrations as low as 10 (2) CFU/g.
      Conclusion: The novel CRISPR/Cas12a-VD method for detecting VP performed better
      than traditional detection methods, such as real-time PCR, and has great
      potential for preventing the spread of pathogens.

TI  - Effect of Different N:P Ratios on the Growth, Toxicity, and Toxin Profile of
      Gymnodinium catenatum (Dinophyceae) Strains from the Gulf of California.
LID - 501 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/toxins14070501 [doi]
AB  - The harmful microalgae Gymnodinium catenatum is a unique naked dinoflagellate
      that produces paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins (PSTs). This species is common
      along the coasts of the Mexican Pacific and is responsible for paralytic
      shellfish poisoning, which has resulted in notable financial losses in both
      fisheries and aquaculture. In the Gulf of California, G. catenatum has been
      related to mass mortality events in fish, shrimp, seabirds, and marine mammals.
      In this study, the growth, toxin profiles, and toxin content of four G. catenatum
      strains isolated from Bahia de La Paz (BAPAZ) and Bahia de Mazatlan (BAMAZ) were 
      evaluated with different N:P ratios, keeping the phosphorus concentration
      constant. All strains were cultivated in semi-continuous cultures (200 mL, 21.0
      degrees C, 120 micromol photon m(-2)s(-1), and a 12:12 h light-dark cycle) with
      f/2 + Se medium using N:P ratios of: 4:1, 8:1, 16:1, 32:1, and 64:1. Paralytic
      toxins were analyzed by HPLC with fluorescence detection. Maximum cellular
      abundance and growth were obtained at an N:P ratio of 64:1 (3188 cells mL(-1) and
      0.34 div day(-1)) with the BAMAZ and BAPAZ strains. A total of ten saxitoxin
      analogs dominated by N-sulfocarbamoyl (60-90 mol%), decarbamoyl (10-20 mol%), and
      carbamoyl (5-10 mol%) toxins were detected. The different N:P ratios did not
      cause significant changes in the PST content or toxin profiles of the strains
      from both bays, although they did affect cell abundance.

TI  - Low water pH depressed growth and early development of giant freshwater prawn
      Macrobrachium rosenbergii larvae.
PG  - e09989
LID - 10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09989 [doi]
AB  - Macrobrachium rosenbergii is one of the shellfish species with high aquaculture
      value due to its increasing market demand. However, the comparatively low
      production volume compared to demand coupled with the rapid decline of the
      natural environment, consequently, drives the potential depletion of the wild
      population. The decrease in water pH related to anthropogenic pollution is one of
      the most critical factors affecting the early life performances of M.
      rosenbergii. Therefore, this study was designed to examine the effect of low
      water pH on feeding, growth and development of M. rosenbergii early life stages. 
      Experimental water pH was set as neutral (7.7 +/- 0.4); mild-acidic (6.4 +/- 0.5)
      and acidic (5.4 +/- 0.2) with triplication at a stocking density of 2 larvae/L
      for 30 days. As expected, M. rosenbergii larvae were highly sensitive to acidic
      pH with no larvae survived beyond 48 h of exposure. Feeding, survival and growth 
      of larvae were adversely affected by mild-acidic pH exposure as compared to
      neutral pH. Larvae exposed to mild-acidic water pH experienced a prolonged larval
      period and only metamorphosed to the post-larval stage at day-30. Whilst under
      neutral water pH, larval that metamorphosed to post-larval was first observed on 
      day-23. The negative impact of decreased pH, even in mild-acidic pH exposure, on 
      the feeding, survival, growth and development of M. rosenbergii larvae highlights
      the urgency of periodic pH monitoring during M. rosenbergii larviculture.

AB  - A major paradigm shift in the field of nanobiotechnology is the invention of an
      eco-friendly, economical, and green approach for synthesis of metal
      nanoparticles. In the present study, we have synthesized gold nanoparticles
      (AuNPs) using aqueous extracts of marine brown seaweed Sargassum longifolium. The
      synthesized nanoparticle was subjected to characterization using different
      techniques such as UV-Vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, 
      atomic force microscope, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron
      microscope, and elemental dispersive X-ray diffraction. Further, the seaweed
      extract and the synthesized AuNPs were evaluated for its anticancer effect using 
      MG-63 human osteosarcoma cells besides in vitro antioxidant effect. The formation
      of S. longifolium-mediated synthesis of gold nanoparticles was demonstrated by
      UV-Vis spectroscopy. Presence of elemental gold was confirmed by EDX analysis.
      TEM analysis demonstrated spherical morphology of the synthesized AuNPs and SEM
      analysis revealed the particle size to be in the range of 10-60 nm. The FTIR
      showed the presence of hydroxyl functional groups. The toxicity of S. longifolium
      extract and the synthesized AuNPs was tested using brine shrimp lethality assay
      at different concentrations with results showing both seaweed extract and AuNPs
      to be nontoxic. Both S. longifolium and AuNPs exhibited significant antioxidant
      activity by scavenging DPPH free radicals and H2O2 radicals. Significant
      antiproliferative effect was observed against MG-63 osteosarcoma cells. It was
      also shown that the seaweed extract and the AuNPs induced cytotoxicity in cell
      lines by mechanism of apoptosis. In conclusion, this study provided insight on
      AuNPs synthesized from S. longifolium as a potent antioxidant and anticancer
      agent.

AB  - The emerging demand for the enhancement of biodegradation of persistent organic
      pollutants from marine oil spills using oil-treating agents to minimize the
      environmental impacts promotes the development of green dispersants. Shrimp waste
      is a potential raw material to generate green dispersants. The biodegradability
      of dispersed oil and dispersants themselves are key factors for the national
      consideration of the approval, stockpile, and usage of dispersants. However, it
      is unknown whether shrimp-waste-based dispersant (SWD) has high bioavailability
      or facilitates the biodegradation of dispersed oil. In this study, we tackled the
      biodegradation of oil dispersed by a purified SWD. Furthermore, the SWD
      biodegradability was evaluated by exploring the degradation genes via metagenomic
      sequencing, analyzing the enzymatic activities for dispersant biodegradation by
      molecular docking, and discussing the SWD toxicity. We discovered that the SWD
      facilitated the biodegradation of two crude oils (Alaska North Slope and Marine
      Fuel-No.6). The metagenomic analysis with molecular docking showed that fresh
      seawater had feasible enzymes to degrade the SWD to safety components.
      Additionally, the SWD was low toxic and high bioactive. The findings helped
      confirm that the purified SWD is an effective and eco-sustainable marine oil
      spill treating agent and tracked the biodegradation of dispersed oil and the SWD.

TI  - Effects of dietary chenodeoxycholic acid supplementation in a low fishmeal diet
      on growth performance, lipid metabolism, autophagy and intestinal health of
      Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei.
LID - S1050-4648(22)00434-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.fsi.2022.07.045 [doi]
AB  - An 8-week feeding trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of chenodeoxycholic
      acid (CDCA) on growth performance, body composition, lipid metabolism, and
      intestinal health of juvenile white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei fed a low
      fishmeal diet. Four practical diets were formulated: HFM (25% fishmeal), LFM (15%
      fishmeal), LB1 (LFM + 0.04% CDCA), LB2 (LFM + 0.08% CDCA). Each diet was assigned
      to four tanks with forty shrimp (initial weight 0.33 +/- 0.03 g) per tank. The
      results indicated that the growth performance of shrimp were similar between the 
      four groups; the crude lipid content of shrimp fed the LB2 diet was significantly
      lower than those fed the HFM diet (P<0.05). The lipase activity content in
      hepatopancreatic were significantly higher in the two CDCA supplemented groups
      than that in LFM group; the contents of total cholesterol, low-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in hemolymph were
      significantly lower in LFM group, LB1 group and LB2 group than that in HFM group 
      (P<0.05). The shrimp fed LB1 diet was significantly decreased the intestinal
      expression levels of tube than those fed in HFM diet; the intestinal gene
      expression of imd and toll were significantly lower in LB2 group than those in
      HFM group (P<0.05). The results of hepatopancreas gene expression suggest that
      shrimp fed the LFM diet showed significantly upregulated expression levels of
      sterol regulatory element-binding protein (srebp), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (acc), 
      and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (cpt-1) than those fed the HFM diet; shrimp 
      fed the LB1 diet showed significantly upregulated expression levels of srebp,
      acc, and AMP-activated protein kinase (ampk) than those fed the HFM diet; shrimp 
      fed the LB2 diet had higher expression levels of srebp, acc, and cpt-1 than those
      fed the HFM diet (P<0.05). In the hepatopancreas, the shrimp fed the LFM diet
      shown significantly up-regulated the expression levels of beclin1 compared to
      those fed HFM diet; the expression levels of atg3, autophagy-related protein 12
      (atg12) of in shrimp fed the LB1 diet were significantly higher than those fed
      the HFM diet; and the expression levels of autophagy-related protein13 (atg13),
      beclin1, atg3, atg12, autophagy-related protein 9 (atg9) of shrimp fed LB2 diet
      were significantly higher than those fed the HFM diet (P<0.05). The
      autophagy-related protein 3 (atg3) in intestine of shrimp fed the LB2 diet were
      significantly higher than those fed the HFM diet (P<0.05). Intestinal mucous fold
      were damaged, hepatic tubules were disorganized and B cells appeared to be
      swollen in LFM group. The fold height and width of shrimp fed the diets
      supplemented with CDCA increased significantly than those fed the LFM diet
      (P<0.05), the hepatic tubules were neatly arranged, and R cells increased. In
      conclusion, supplementary CDCA in a low fishmeal diet promoted lipid metabolism, 
      enhanced autophagy of shrimp, also improved the health of the intestine and
      hepatopancreas.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with allergic rhinitis to house dust mites have an increased
      risk of shrimp allergy. Der p 10 is a candidate biomarker to predict the risk of 
      shrimp allergy among allergic rhinitis patients. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this
      study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of anti-Der p 10 IgE as a
      predictor of shrimp allergy. METHODS: A nested case-control study was carried out
      with eighty-six allergic rhinitis patients sensitized to mite (Dermatophagoides
      pteronyssinus) and shrimp (Litopenaeu vannamei). Cases and controls were defined 
      by anti-Der p 10 IgE results. Oral challenge with shrimp was used as the gold
      standard for the evaluation of diagnostic performance. RESULTS: All shrimp oral
      challenge test (OCT)-positive patients were positive for IgE against Der p 10.
      The level of anti-Der p 10 IgE >1.2 kUA/mL had the best diagnostic performance
      (sensitivity 100%, specificity 65%) Conclusion: Anti-Der p 10 IgE is useful for
      predicting shrimp allergy diagnosis and could reduce the requirement of an OCT.

AB  - Mangroves play a vital role in protecting the coastal community from the climate 
      change effect and in the restoration of the coastal ecosystem. This research has 
      been designed to determine the spatial and seasonal changes of potentially toxic 
      elements' (PTEs) concentration in sediments and their potential source
      contribution among the different human-driven processes in Sundarbans,
      Bangladesh. Different pollution evaluation indices, random forest (RF) model,
      conditional inference tree (CIT), self-organizing map (SOM), geographical
      information system (GIS), and principal component analysis (PCA) were used for
      the interpretation of sources and risk assessment of PTEs. The mean concentration
      of PTEs both in winter and monsoon seasons has fallen below the threshold effect 
      level but exceeded the rare effect level of marine sediments quality standards.
      Results showed that the PTEs were significantly enriched (EF>1.00<70.00) in
      sediments, whereas the Cd enrichment (7.00% samples) was very alarming
      (EF=60-70). Except for Zn and Cd, other PTEs were enriched in 30-60% samples. The
      highest geoaccumulation and contamination factors for Cd were observed in 46-72% 
      of samples. The ecological risk (ER) factors showed similar results where Cd
      showed strong to very strong factors (ER=110-2218) in 80% of samples. The CIT
      explained the natural/geogenic and anthropogenic sources of pollution, where the 
      higher CIT values for Cd indicated industrial, aquaculture, and coal-based
      thermal powerplant. The RF model provided that shrimp firms, power plants,
      industry, and seaport were recognized as the influential sources for Zn, Pb, Cr, 
      Cd, and As in sediments. Though Pb and As were found as the most significant
      pollutants, Cd was identified as a severe threat to ecology and public health.
      Based on CIT, RF, SOM and PCA the order of PTEs in mangroves sediment
      were:industrial/urban>aquaculture/shrimpfirm>powerplant>seaportoperation>tourism>
      geogenic/natural. The present study will help the policymakers for effective and 
      sustainable management of the mangrove ecosystem.

AB  - Since proteins play an important role in the life of an organism, many
      researchers are now looking at how genes and proteins interact to form different 
      proteins. It is anticipated that the creation of adequate tools for rapid
      analysis of proteins will accelerate the determination of functional aspects of
      these biomolecules and develop new biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the
      diagnosis and treatment of various diseases. Though shrimp contains high-quality 
      marine proteins, there are reports about the heavy losses to the shrimp industry 
      due to the poor quality of shrimp production and many times due to mass mortality
      also. Frequent outbreaks of diseases, water pollution, and quality of feed are
      some of the most recognized reasons for such losses. In the seafood export
      market, shrimp occupies the top position in currency earnings and strengthens the
      economy of many developing nations. Therefore, it is vital for shrimp-producing
      companies they produce healthy shrimp with high-quality protein. Though
      aquaculture is a very competitive market, global awareness regarding the use of
      scientific knowledge and emerging technologies to obtain better-farmed organisms 
      through sustainable production has enhanced the importance of proteomics in
      seafood biology research. Proteomics, as a powerful tool, has therefore been
      increasingly used to address several issues in shrimp aquaculture. In the present
      paper, efforts have been made to address some of them, particularly the role of
      proteomics in reproduction, breeding and spawning, immunological responses and
      disease resistance capacity, nutrition and health, microbiome and probiotics,
      quality and safety of shrimp production, bioinformatics applications in
      proteomics, the discovery of protein biomarkers, and mitigating biotic and
      abiotic stresses. Future challenges and research directions on proteomics in
      shrimp aquaculture have also been discussed.

AB  - Arsenolipids are the primary form of arsenic in the fat of marine organisms.
      Because seafood is a common source of arsenic exposure and some arsenolipids are 
      toxic, studying the abundance and species of arsenolipids in seafood is crucial
      for health risk assessment. Current arsenolipid research is confined by
      analytical techniques and limited to raw seafood analysis, despite the fact that 
      most seafood is ingested cooked. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate 
      which seafood contributes to arsenolipid dietary intake and investigate the
      changes in arsenolipids before and after cooking. In Chongqing, China, popular
      seafood such as clam, shrimp, oyster, abalone, hairtail, and yellow croaker were 
      collected. The raw and cooked samples prepared from these seafood products were
      examined using a non-targeted screening approach established for arsenolipids,
      which coupled high-performance liquid chromatography with data-independent
      high-resolution quadrupole-time-of-flight electrospray ionization tandem mass
      spectrometry. Arsenic-containing hydrocarbons (AsHC330, AsHC332, and AsHC360),
      arsenic-containing fatty acids (AsFA362, AsFA390, AsFA404, AsFA418, and AsFA422),
      trimethylarsine oxide, and thiolated trimethylarsinic acid were detected. The
      species of arsenolipids in each type of seafood remained intact after heating in 
      the microwave oven. In cooked samples, the concentrations of AsFA362 and AsFA390 
      were significantly lower than in raw samples, whereas the concentrations of other
      arsenolipids were unchanged. Microwave cooking did not result in the thiolation
      of the detected arsenolipids. The most detected species in raw and cooked samples
      were AsFA362, AsFA390, and AsFA418. Most arsenolipid species were found in the
      highest levels in hairtails and yellow croakers. It is the first time that
      arsenolipids have been found in the oyster, abalone, abalone liver, and yellow
      croaker. The present study contributes to a better understanding of arsenolipids 
      exposure from seafood, which is useful for assessing the health risks of arsenic.

AB  - Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) are an important cause of foodborne illness 
      in humans with infections ranging from mild non-bloody diarrhea to bloody
      diarrhea (BD) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This study aimed to
      investigate the distribution of STEC in shellfish from coastal shores of Lake
      Timsah in Ismailia Governorate, Egypt and its probable hazard to seafood
      consumers. Samples from the external surface and tissues of shrimp (n = 45),
      crabs (n = 45), and oysters (n = 45) batches were examined bacteriologically for 
      the presence of STEC and tested for their antibiotic sensitivity. Moreover,
      occurrence of virulence genes was determined via detection of stx1, stx2 and eaeA
      genes using PCR. Overall, E. coli and presumptive STEC isolates (from CHROMagar) 
      were identified from the surface (55.6 and 5.9%) and tissues (42.2 and 8.9%) of
      the examined shellfish batches, respectively. Five STEC isolates had been
      confirmed and found belonging to O26:H11, O125:H6, O146:H21, and O159 serogroups,
      those were 4 isolates from tissues of the three shellfish species and one isolate
      from the crab surface. The STEC isolates were multi-drug resistant, showing
      complete resistance to; penicillins, amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, colistin,
      fosfomycin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, and tetracycline, however, they were
      sensitive to gentamycin except O159 serogroup. The current study revealed low
      level of contamination of shellfish from coastal shores of Lake Timsah with STEC,
      however, it also highlights the extreme level of antimicrobial resistance
      exhibited by the presumptive and confirmed STEC isolates which is very hazardous 
      for seafood consumers in the study area.

TI  - Assessment of Various Standard Fish Diets on Growth and Fecundity of Platyfish
      (Xiphophorus maculatus) and Medaka (Oryzias latipes).
LID - 10.1089/zeb.2022.0004 [doi]
AB  - Several small freshwater fish species are utilized as models for human conditions
      and disease in biomedical research. Research animal diets are generally tailored 
      to optimize growth, fecundity, and produce healthy research animals. However, a
      lack of reference diets presents a barrier in comparative studies between aquatic
      animal models and even among laboratories using the same species. Therefore, the 
      objective of this study was to determine feeding regime and dietary effects on
      growth and fecundity in two commonly used freshwater fish, platyfish and medaka. 
      From 1 through 6 months of age, platyfish and medaka were fed one of three
      feeding regime/diets: (1) our custom feeding regime consists of commercial flake 
      food, beef liver paste, and live brine shrimp (CON); (2) a commercially available
      zebrafish diet, Gemma (GEM); and (3) a laboratory defined reference feeding
      regime (WAT). Weight, size, brood numbers, and survival rates for both species
      were measured monthly. Numbers of platyfish fry and hatch rate of medaka embryos 
      were also determined. We observed that custom feeding regime (CON) fed platyfish 
      and medaka grew larger, exhibited a higher survival rate, and had higher
      fecundity than WAT or GEM fed fish. These observations suggest that diets and
      regimes designed for zebrafish are not optimal to maintain platyfish or medaka.
      Thus, base diets, with clearly defined components and regimes, need to be
      developed with compositions that can be adjusted in a species-specific manner.

TI  - White Spot Syndrome Virus Triggers a Glycolytic Pathway in Shrimp Immune Cells
      (Hemocytes) to Benefit Its Replication.

LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.901111 [doi]
AB  - White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is the causative agent of a shrimp disease that 
      inflicts in huge economic losses in shrimp-farming industry. WSSV triggers
      aerobic glycolysis in shrimp immune cells (hemocytes), but how this virus
      regulates glycolytic enzymes or pathway is yet to be characterized. Therefore,
      mRNA levels and activity of four important glycolytic enzymes, Hexokinase (HK),
      Phosphofructokinase (PFK), Pyruvate kinase (PK), and Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH),
      were measured in WSSV-infected shrimp hemocytes. Gene expression of HK and PFK,
      but not LDH or PK, was increased at the viral genome replication stage (12 hpi); 
      furthermore, activity of these enzymes, except HK, was concurrently increased.
      However, there was no increased enzyme activity at the viral late stage (24 hpi).
      In vivo dsRNA silencing and glycolysis disruption by 2-DG further confirmed the
      role of glycolysis in virus replication. Based on tracing studies using stable
      isotope labeled glucose, glycolysis was activated at the viral genome replication
      stage, but not at the viral late stage. This study demonstrated that WSSV
      enhanced glycolysis by activating glycolytic enzyme at the viral genome
      replication stage, providing energy and biomolecules for virus replication.

      corresponding target protein in shrimp that mediates their action has not been
      identified. By screening yeast two-hybrid cDNA libraries from intestine, stomach,
      and hepatopancreas of Litopenaeus vannamei, the protein with the largest increase
      in gene expression in shrimp hepatopancreas in response to VPAHPND challenge was 
      identified and designated LvFABP. Analysis revealed high sequence homology of the
      LvFABP gene and a lipocalin/cytosolic fatty acid binding gene. Yeast two-hybrid
      pairwise analysis, GST-pull down assay, and far-western blot assay were performed
      to determine the interaction between LvFABP and PirB(vp). LvFABP was able to
      directly bind to PirB(vp). The expression of LvFABP in the hepatopancreas was
      significantly higher at P23 and P27 developmental stages of L. vannamei. RNA
      interference (RNAi) of LvFABP reduced the mortality, histopathological signs of
      AHPND in the hepatopancreas, and the number of virulent VPAHPND bacteria in the
      intestine, stomach, and hepatopancreas after VPAHPND challenge. We concluded that
      the LvFABP was involved in AHPND pathogenesis and acted as a VPAHPND toxin
      interacting protein. This is the first identification of VPAHPND toxin
      interacting protein from the shrimp digestive system by yeast two-hybrid library 
      screening and were confirmed by in vitro protein interaction verification and in 
      vivo challenge experiments. This study provides novel insight into the
      contributions of LvFABP towards AHPND pathogenesis in shrimp. The findings could 
      inform AHPND preventative measures in shrimp farming.

TI  - Heat Shock Protein 70 Is a Damage-Associated Molecular Pattern That by Binding to
      Lipopolysaccharide and beta-1,3-Glucan-Binding Protein Activates the
      Prophenoloxidase System in Shrimp.
LID - ji2100804 [pii]
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.2100804 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies have initiated a paradigm shift in understanding heat shock
      protein 70 (HSP70) functions in the shrimp immune system. However, the mechanism 
      by which Litopenaeus vannamei (Lv)HSP70 modulates the innate immune response
      remains unclear. This study shows that LvHSP70 binds to the pattern recognition
      receptor LPS and beta-1,3-glucan-binding protein (LvLGBP), and subsequently leads
      to the activation of the prophenoloxidase system. Injection of shrimp with
      rLvHSP70 significantly (p < 0.05) upregulated the gene and protein expression of 
      the key pattern recognition receptor LvLGBP. A coimmunoprecipitation and
      ELISA-based binding assay strongly confirmed the binding of LvHSP70 to LvLGBP at 
      polysaccharide recognition motifs (PLS motifs) with a K d of 4.44 muM and its
      competitive binding with LPS (IC50) is 8.036 muM. Conversely, LPS efficiently
      competed with LvHSP70 for binding to LvLGBP in a concentration-dependent manner
      with an IC50 of 7.662 muM, indicating that both are ligands of LvLGBP and likely 
      bind at the same site. Binding of LvHSP70 to LvLGBP highly activated
      phenoloxidase activity in shrimp hemocyte lysate supernatants. Gene silencing of 
      LvLGBP impaired the activation of phenoloxidase activity in shrimp by rLvHSP70,
      indicating that LvHSP70-LvLGBP interaction was essential for stimulating the
      immune cascade. Taken together, these results demonstrated that LvHSP70 is a
      ligand of LvLGBP similar to LPS and acts as a damage-associated molecular pattern
      to modulate the shrimp immune system via the prophenoloxidase system, eventually 
      leading to the production of melanin and toxic reactive intermediates against
      invading pathogens.

TI  - The earliest known brood care in insects.
PG  - 20220447
LID - 10.1098/rspb.2022.0447 [doi]
AB  - Brood care enhances offspring fitness and survival by providing protection or
      feeding through parents (commonly by females). It has evolved independently
      multiple times in animals, e.g. mammals, birds, dinosaurs and arthropods,
      especially various lineages of insects, and has significant implications for
      understanding the emergence of sociality of insects. However, few fossil insects 
      document such an ephemeral behaviour directly. New exceptional fossils of the
      water boatman Karataviella popovi from the Middle-Late Jurassic Daohugou biota
      (ca 163.5 Ma, northeastern China), with adult females bearing clutches of eggs on
      their left mesotibia, provide a unique brooding strategy (asymmetric egg-carrying
      behaviour) unknown in all extinct and extant insects. Our discovery represents
      the earliest direct evidence of brood care among insects, pushing back by more
      than 38 million years, indicating that relevant adaptations associated with
      maternal investment of insects can be traced back to at least the Middle-Late
      Jurassic, and highlighting the existence of diverse brooding strategies in
      Mesozoic insects. In addition, our discovery reveals that a specialized
      trawl-like filter-capture apparatus of K. popovi probably represents
      pre-adaptions originally used for trapping coeval anostracan (fairy shrimp) eggs 
      for food.

AB  - To retard the deterioration of texture and color of ready-to-eat (RTE) shrimps
      during storage, phytic acid (PA) and lactic acid (LA) were used to soak the
      shrimp prior to cooking. The factors affecting texture (water holding capacity,
      protein oxidation and degradation, and microstructure) and color (Maillard
      reaction and lipid oxidation) were determined separately. The free radical and
      copper ion content were also determined in order to investigate the regulation
      mechanism of phytic acid and lactic acid on the texture and color of RTE shrimps.
      It was found that the inhibitor-treated RTE shrimps showed better texture and
      color properties than the control group, and the compound inhibitor (PA + LA)
      showed a better inhibition effect than single inhibitor. In addition, PA and LA
      prevented the oxidation of RTE shrimps by scavenging free radicals and chelating 
      copper ions, which in turn enabled the regulation of color and texture
      deterioration.

      Antibacterial Activity.
LID - ji2200078 [pii]
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.2200078 [doi]
AB  - Although invertebrates' innate immunity relies on several immune-like molecules, 
      the diversity of these molecules and their immune response mechanisms are not
      well understood. Here, we show that Penaeus vannamei hemocyanin (PvHMC) undergoes
      specific deacetylation under Vibrio parahaemolyticus and LPS challenge. In vitro 
      deacetylation of PvHMC increases its binding capacity with LPS and antibacterial 
      activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Lysine residues K481 and K484 on the
      Ig-like domain of PvHMC are the main acetylation sites modulated by the
      acetyltransferase TIP60 and deacetylase HDAC3. Deacetylation of PvHMC on K481 and
      K484 allows PvHMC to form a positively charged binding pocket that interacts
      directly with LPS, whereas acetylation abrogates the positive charge to decrease 
      PvHMC-LPS attraction. Besides, V. parahaemolyticus and LPS challenge increases
      the expression of Pvhdac3 to induce PvHMC deacetylation. This work indicates
      that, during bacterial infections, deacetylation of hemocyanin is crucial for
      binding with LPS to clear Gram-negative bacteria in crustaceans.

AB  - SH2-domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), belonging to the
      class I PTP superfamily, are responsible for the dephosphorylation on the
      phosphorylated tyrosine residues in some proteins that are involved in multiple
      biological processes in eukaryotes. The Janus kinase/signal transducers and
      activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway transduce signaling responding to 
      interferons and initiate cellular antiviral responses. The activity of the
      JAK/STAT pathway is generally orchestrated by the de-/phosphorylation of the
      tyrosine and serine residues of JAKs and STATs, in which the dephosphorylation
      processes are mainly controlled by PTPs. In the present study, an
      SH2-domian-contianing PTP, temporally named as LvPTPN6, was identified in
      Litopenaeus vannamei. LvPTPN6 shares high similarity with PTPN6s from other
      organisms and was phylogenetically categorized into the clade of arthropods that 
      differs from those of fishes and mammals. LvPTPN6 was constitutively expressed in
      all detected tissues, located mainly in the cytoplasm, and differentially induced
      in hemocyte and gill after the challenge of stimulants, indicating its
      complicated regulatory roles in shrimp immune responses. Intriguingly, the
      expression of LvPTPN6 was regulated by interferon regulatory factor (IRF), which 
      could directly bind to the LvPTPN6 promoter. Surprisingly, unlike other PTPN6s,
      LvPTPN6 could promote the dimerization of STAT and facilitate its nuclear
      localization, which further elevated the expression of STAT-targeting immune
      effector genes and enhanced the antiviral immunity of shrimp. Therefore, this
      study suggests a PTPN6-mediated regulatory approach from IRF to the JAK/STAT
      signaling pathway in shrimp, which provides new insights into the regulatory
      roles of PTPs in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and contributes to the further
      understanding of the mechanisms of antiviral immunity in invertebrates.

AB  - The denaturation of proteins (particularly myosin) due to freezing can lead to
      the deterioration of Penaeus vannamei. The purpose of this study was to verify
      the antifreeze protective effects of polyphenols screened by a molecular docking 
      technique, and to explore their interactions with myosin after freezing
      treatment. It was found that the screened polyphenols could significantly
      increase the freezing rate and unfreezable water content of shrimp paste. The
      results of fluorescence spectra indicated that the hesperetin to myosin quenching
      process included both dynamic and static quenching, and it was primarily bound to
      myosin through hydrophobic interactions; The quenching of myosin by both
      dihydroquercetin and mangiferin was static quenching, and they were bound to
      myosin mainly by hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces; All three of these
      polyphenols had only one binding site on myosin. Surface hydrophobicity indicated
      that all four polyphenols were engaged in non-covalent binding (hydrophobic
      interactions) with myosin. Infrared spectra demonstrated that the addition of
      these four polyphenols significantly increased the alpha-helix content of myosin.
      They also reduced the myosin particle size, zeta potential, and protein
      degeneration degree. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the four
      polyphenols reduced the degree of aggregation, while more uniformly distributing 
      the myosin particles. These observations provide a basis for the screening of
      polyphenols and further research into the protective mechanism of polyphenols on 
      frozen myosin.

AB  - Hypoxia is a common concern in shrimp aquaculture, affecting growth and survival.
      Although recent studies have revealed important insights into hypoxia in shrimp
      and crustaceans, knowledge gaps remain regarding this stressor at the molecular
      level. In the present study, a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based
      metabolomics approach was employed to characterize the metabolic signatures and
      pathways underlying responses of Pacific white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) to
      hypoxia and to identify associated candidate biomarkers. We compared metabolite
      profiles of shrimp haemolymph before (0 h) and after exposure to hypoxia (1 & 2
      h). Dissolved oxygen levels were maintained above 85 % saturation in the control 
      and before hypoxia, and 15 % saturation in the hypoxic stress treatment. Results 
      showed 44 metabolites in shrimp haemolymph that were significantly different
      between before and after hypoxia exposure. These metabolites were energy-related 
      metabolites (e.g., intermediates of citric acid cycle, lactic acid, alanine),
      fatty acids and amino acids. Pathway analysis revealed 17 pathways that were
      significantly affected by hypoxia. The changes in metabolites and pathways
      indicate a shift from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism, disturbance in amino acid 
      metabolism, osmoregulation, oxidative damage and Warburg effect-like response
      caused by hypoxic stress. Among the altered metabolites, lactic acid was most
      different between before and after hypoxia exposure and had the highest accurate 
      value for biomarker identification. Future investigations may validate this
      molecule as a stress biomarker in aquaculture. This study contributes to a better
      understanding of hypoxia in shrimp and crustaceans at the metabolic level and
      provides a base for future metabolomics investigations on hypoxia.

AB  - Litopenaeus vannamei is the most important shrimp species throughout the world.
      However, diseases are increasing with the development of the industry, so
      enhancing the immunity of shrimp is of great significance. In this study, 1800
      shrimp were divided into two groups randomly: the control group (N, feed with
      brine shrimp flake) and the experimental group (M, feed with mutant of
      Synechocystis sp. cells) (300 shrimp/group/replication) and each trial was
      conducted in triplicates. After immunization, sixty shrimp (with three replicates
      of twenty) were collected at 0h in group N and 24, 72, and 144h in group M,
      respectively, and the hepatopancreas were isolated for transcriptomic and
      metabolomic analysis. Transcriptome data revealed that compared with group N,
      genes related to antimicrobial peptides, cytoskeleton remodeling, detoxification,
      apoptosis, blood coagulation, immune defense, and antioxidant systems were
      differentially expressed in group M. In addition, combined transcriptomic and
      metabolomic analysis revealed that some immune-related differential genes or
      differential metabolites were consistently expressed in both omics. All the above
      results indicated that trans-vp28 gene Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 could improve
      the immunity of L. vannamei. This is the first report of the integration of
      dynamic transcriptomics combined with metabolomics to study the effect of
      trans-vp28 gene Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 in the hepatopancreas of L. vannamei
      and provided important information about the defense and immune mechanisms used
      by invertebrates against pathogens.

AB  - Fish meal is increasingly being replaced by plant protein raw materials,
      meanwhile, it brings phytic acid, which combines with phosphorus to form phytate 
      phosphorus and leads to a low utilization rate of phosphorus in shrimp. To solve 
      this problem, this study investigated the effects of phytase supplementation on
      growth performance, phosphorus utilization, antioxidants, and digestion in red
      swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii). Crayfish (initial mean weight: 8.69 +/-
      0.15 g, N = 324) were randomly divided into six groups each with three replicates
      of 18 individuals each, and hand-fed for 8 weeks with one of six experimental
      diets (50 and 490 g kg(-1) animal and plant protein raw material, respectively): 
      negative control (NC; 11.0 g kg(-1) phosphorus), positive control (PC; 15 g
      kg(-1) NaH2PO4 added to NC; 14.7 g kg(-1) phosphorus), and phytase
      supplementation diets (P1-P4: 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 g kg(-1) phytase added to
      NC, respectively). The feeding trial was performed in a micro-flow water culture 
      system. P2 showed a significantly higher weight gain rate (WGR), specific growth 
      rate, protein efficiency ratio, and protein retention efficiency (PRE) but showed
      the lowest feed conversion ratio (FCR) than other groups. Broken-line regression 
      analyses using WGR, FCR, and PRE as evaluation indices showed that the optimal
      dietary phytase supplementation level was 0.233, 0.244, and 0.303 g kg(-1),
      respectively. P2 showed the highest crude protein content of whole crayfish and
      abdominal muscle, and phosphorus deposition rate, which was significantly higher 
      than that in NC and PC. P3 showed the highest calcium and phosphorus contents in 
      whole crayfish and phosphorus content in abdominal muscle, and calcium and
      inorganic phosphorus content in serum, which were significantly higher than those
      in NC. P3 showed significantly lowest serum alkaline phosphatase, alanine
      aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase activities, malondialdehyde content in
      hepatopancreas, and highest catalase activity, which were significantly lower and
      higher, respectively, than those in NC and PC. In summary, the addition of
      0.2-0.4 g kg(-1) phytase significantly improves the growth performance, feed
      utilization, digestive enzyme activity, and antioxidant of P. clarkii, which has 
      a similar effect to the direct addition of NaH2PO4 at 15 g kg(-1) to the feed.

TI  - miR-144 and DJ-1/NF-kB regulates UCP4 maintain mitochondrial homeostasis in
      Penaeus vannamei.

AB  - UCP4, as an uncoupling protein in mitochondrial intima, is closely related to the
      resistance to oxidative stress and the function of mitochondria. However, whether
      and how its antioxidant capacity also works in crustaceans has not been reported 
      in detail. This study showed that the expression of PvUCP4 was negatively
      correlated with the expression of pva-miR-144. The content of reactive oxygen
      species (ROS), ATP, and apoptosis was significantly increased, while the
      mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was seriously depolarized, Edema,
      vacuolation, and ambiguity of cristae and membrane were observed clearly in
      mitochondria after the knockdown of PvUCP4 induced by V. alginolyticus. The sharp
      drop in THC and severe damage in the hepatopancreas were all due to the knockout 
      of PvUCP4 under the stress of V. alginolyticus. The co-transfection of
      pva-miR-144 and PvUCP4 could partially recover MMP compared with the abnormal
      expression of pva-miR-144. Similarly, co-transfection of pva-miR-144 and PvUCP4
      could partially eliminate apoptosis compared with the abnormal expression of
      pva-miR-144. In addition, PvUCP4 3'-UTR has a pva-miR-144 predicted binding site 
      in 1417-1428, which also was confirmed by the dual luciferase reporter assay. By 
      the way, the results of ROS, MMP, and apoptosis showed that PvDJ-1 regulated the 
      expression of PvUCP4 through PvNF-kappaB. Altogether, these results indicated
      that PvUCP4 has the antioxidant function of resisting oxidation reaction and
      weakening oxidative damage, to protect the normal operation of mitochondrial
      function and maintaining the cell homeostasis in shrimp.

AB  - In this work, a magnetic covalent organic framework/graphene oxide composite
      (MCOF/GO) was rapidly synthesized and developed as a promising candidate for the 
      magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE). Combined with HPLC-MS, an efficient and
      rapid analytical method was established for the determination of oseltamivir (OS)
      in aquatic products. The resultant composite not only exhibited superior
      extraction efficiency, but also possessed fast mass transfer kinetic, reducing
      the pretreatment time greatly. Under optimal conditions, the linear range of the 
      proposed method for OS determination was found to be 0.1-10 mug/kg along with a
      satisfactory correlation coefficient (R(2) = 0.997) and a low limit of detection 
      (LOD, 0.035 mug/kg). Furthermore, the established method was utilized to
      determine OS in Carp, Yellow croaker, and Shrimp, where the recoveries ranged
      from 87% to 116%. These results demonstrate the splendid application potential of
      this method to detect antiviral drugs in actual aquatic products.

TI  - High nutrient induces virulence in the AHPND-causing Vibrio parahaemolyticus,
      interpretation from the ecological assembly of shrimp gut microbiota.

AB  - Shrimp diseases frequently occur during the later farming stages, when the
      rearing water is eutrophic. This observation provides clue that the virulence of 
      pathogens could be induced by elevated nutrient, whereas the underlying
      ecological mechanism remains limited. To address this pressing knowledge, we
      explored how gut microbiota responded to the infection of oligotrophic (OVp) or
      eutrophic (EVp) pre-cultured Vibrio parahaemolyticus, a causing pathogen of
      shrimp acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND). Resulted revealed that
      OVp and EVp infections caused dysbiosis in the gut microbiota and compromised
      shrimp immunity, while the later infection led to earlier and higher mortality.
      Significant associations were detected between the gut microbiota and each of the
      measured immune activities. Neutral community model showed that the assembly of
      gut microbiota was more strongly governed by deterministic processes in EVp
      infection, followed by EVp infected and control shrimp. Additionally, there were 
      significantly lower temporal turnover rate and average variation degree in the
      gut microbiota in EVp infected shrimp compared with control individuals. Notably,
      we identified 22 infection-discriminatory taxa after ruling out the ontogenic
      effect. Using profiles of the 22 indicators as independent variables, the
      diagnosis model accurately distinguished (an overall 85.9% accuracy) the infected
      status (control, OVp or EVp infected shrimp), with 81.3% accuracy at the initial 
      infection stage. The convergent and deterministic gut microbiota in EVp infected 
      shrimp could partially explain why it is challenge to cure APHND from an
      ecological viewpoint. In addition, we provided a sensitive approach for
      diagnosing the onset of infection, when disease symptom is unobservable.

AB  - The potential synbiotic effects of a Bacillus mixture and chitosan on growth,
      immune responses and disease resistance against Vibrio parahaemolyticus, the
      causative agent of acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) in Pacific
      white shrimp, were intensively investigated. Three effective strains of Bacillus 
      amyloliquefaciens (A), Bacillus pumilus (P) and Bacillus subtilis (S) were mixed 
      in pairs at a ratio of 5 x 10(8):5 x 10(8) CFU/kg diet and coated with the
      prebiotic chitosan (C) at a concentration of 20 mL/kg diet. Five different feed
      treatments were used to feed experimental shrimp for 5 weeks: control (control,
      no synbiotics), chitosan (coat, C) and the synbiotic treatments PAC, PSC and ASC.
      At week 5, the final length, final weight gain, weight gain, length, average
      daily gain, specific growth rate and feed conversion ratio, measured as growth
      parameters, were significantly upregulated in the PSC and ASC groups compared
      with the control and coat groups (P < 0.05). This result was consistent with the 
      expression analysis of two growth-related genes (Rap-2a and GF-II) in the
      hepatopancreas and intestines of treated shrimp, as determined using qRT-PCR. The
      prebiotic chitosan and synbiotics PAC, PSC and ASC strongly induced significant
      differences in the expression of the Rap-2a and GF-II genes in the target organs 
      compared with the expression in the control group at various time points (P <
      0.05). Additionally, application of the synbiotic treatments also significantly
      enhanced the hepatopancreas characteristics and epithelial and intestinal wall
      thicknesses of the shrimp compared with the control. Interestingly, all the
      synbiotic treatments elevated phagocytic activity significantly at weeks 3 and 5 
      compared with that in the other groups. qRT-PCR analysis of immune-related genes 
      also indicated that the prebiotic group and all synbiotic groups showed strong
      expression of anti-lipopolysaccharide (ALF) and prophenoloxidase (proPO) genes in
      the intestine. Finally, the synbiotic groups PAC, PSC and ASC exhibited stronger 
      VPAHPND resistance at 120 h after exposure than the chitosan coat and control
      groups, with survival rates of 41.7 +/- 11.55, 41.7 +/- 0.00, 52.8 +/- 5.77, 30.6
      +/- 15.28 and 22.2 +/- 5.77%, respectively (P < 0.05). Based on the obtained
      information, all synbiotics were recommended for improved growth and immune
      responses, while ASC was the best for disease resistance against VPAHPND in
      Pacific white shrimp.

      eco-friendly chemicals are needed for insect control. So, the current research
      was planned to explore the prospective of Mentha piperita to be used for the
      formulation of larvicides against mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus. The ethanolic 
      and water extracts of M. piperita leaves were prepared using the soxhlet
      apparatus. The extracts were dried and subjected to prepare five concentrations
      multiple of 80 ppm. Each concentration was applied for its larvicidal efficacy
      setting an experiment (in triplicate) in plastic containers of 1000 ml with
      extracts, 30 larvae of all four instars separately, and fed with dog biscuits
      along with controls. Observations were taken after each 12 hrs. till 72 hrs. The 
      antioxidant perspective of M. piperita was determined by DPPH radical scavenging,
      total antioxidant capacity, and ferric reducing power assays. Using brine shrimp 
      lethality bioactivity, the cytotoxic study was perceived. Standard techniques
      were used to classify the M. piperita extract using preliminary qualitative and
      quantitative phytochemicals, UV-Vis spectroscopy, FT-IR, and GC-MS analysis. M.
      piperita ethanolic leaves extract after 24 hrs. of exposure in 400 ppm showed 93%
      (LC50 = 208.976 ppm) mortality in ethanolic extract and 80% (LC90 = 246.900 ppm) 
      in the water extract. In treated larvae, biochemical examination revealed a
      substantial (P<0.05) decrease in proteins, carbohydrates, and fat contents. The
      ethanol extract of M. piperita was the most efficient, killing brine shrimp
      nauplii in 50% to 90% of cases. TAC (125.4 3.5gAAE/mg DW) and FRP (378.1
      1.0gAAE/mg DW) were highest in the ethanolic extract of M. piperita. The presence
      of medicinally active components such as alkaloids, carbohydrates, flavonoids,
      and others in M. piperita leaves extract in ethanol was discovered. The UV-Vis
      spectrum showed two peaks at 209.509 and 282.814 nm with the absorption of 2.338 
      and 0.796 respectively. The FT-IR consequences exhibited the occurrence of
      alcohols, alkanes, aldehyde, aromatic rings, ether linkage, ester, and halo-
      compounds. The GC-MS analysis according to peak (%) area and retention time
      showed ten phytochemicals consisting of six major and four minor compounds. Among
      all the compounds, 1, 2-benzene dicarboxylic acid, and 3-ethyl-5, 5-dimethyl
      -6-phenyl bound well to the NS3 protease domain with PDB ID: 2FOM. Hence, for the
      prevention of health hazards and mosquito control, M. Piperita is a potential
      source of chemicals for insecticide formulation.

TI  - Corn distillers solubles as a novel bioresource of bioactive peptides with ACE
      and DPP IV inhibition activity: characterization, in silico evaluation, and
      molecular docking.
PG  - 8179-8203
LID - 10.1039/d1fo04109f [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the biological potential of underutilized and
      low-value corn distillers solubles, containing a unique unexplored blend of
      heat-treated corn and yeast proteins, from the bioethanol industries, by
      bioinformatic and biochemical approaches. Protein hydrolysates were produced by
      applying four commercially accessible proteases, among which alcalase provided
      the best results in terms of yield, degree of hydrolysis, molecular weight,
      number of proteins, bioactive peptides, and deactivation against anti-angiotensin
      I-converting enzyme (ACE) and anti-dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV). The optimal 
      conditions to produce anti-ACE and anti-DPP IV peptides were using alcalase for
      10.82 h and an enzyme : substrate ratio of 7.90 (%w/w), with inhibition values
      for ACE and DPP IV of 98.76 +/- 1.28% and 34.99 +/- 1.44%, respectively. Corn
      (alpha-zein) and yeast (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) proteins were
      mainly suitable, upon enzymolysis, for the release of bioactive peptides. The
      peptides DPANLPWG, FDFFDNIN, WNGPPGVF, and TPPFHLPPP inhibited ACE more
      effectively as verified with binding energies of -11.3, -11.6, -10.5, and -11.6
      kcal mol(-1), respectively, as compared to captopril (-6.38 kcal mol(-1)).
      Compared with the binding energy of sitagliptin (-8.6 kcal mol(-1)), WNGPPGVF
      (-9.6 kcal mol(-1)), WPLPPFG (-9.8 kcal mol(-1)), LPPYLPS (-9.7 kcal mol(-1)),
      TPPFHLPPP (-10.1 kcal mol(-1)), and DPANLPWG peptides (-10.1 kcal mol(-1)) had
      greater inhibition potential against DPP IV. The peptides impeded ACE and DPP IV 
      majorly via hydrophobic and hydrogen linkage interactions. The key amino acids
      TYR(523), GLU(384), and HIS(353) were bound to the catalytic sites of ACE and
      GLN(553), GLU(206), PHE(364), VAL(303), and THR(304) were bound to the DPP IV
      enzyme. The PHs can be used as ingredients in the feed or food industries with
      possible health advantages.

TI  - Transcriptomic and Histological Analysis of the Greentail Prawn (Metapenaeus
      bennettae) Following Light Crude Oil Exposure.
LID - 10.1002/etc.5413 [doi]
AB  - Oil spills pose a significant threat to marine biodiversity. Crude oil can
      partition into sediments where it may be persistent, placing benthic species such
      as decapods at particular risk of exposure. Transcriptomic and histological tools
      are often used to investigate the effects of hydrocarbon exposure on marine
      organisms following oil spill events, allowing for the identification of
      metabolic pathways impacted by oil exposure. However, there is limited
      information available for decapod crustaceans, many of which carry significant
      economic value. In the present study, we assess the sublethal impacts of crude
      oil exposure in the commercially important Australian greentail prawn
      (Metapenaeus bennettae) using transcriptomic and histological analyses. Prawns
      exposed to light, unweathered crude oil "spiked" sediments for 90 h were
      transferred to clean sediments for a further 72 h to assess recovery. Chemical
      analyses indicated that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons increased by
      approximately 65% and 91% in prawn muscle following 24 and 90 h of exposure,
      respectively, and significantly decreased during 24- and 72-h recovery periods.
      Transcriptomic responses followed an exposure and recovery pattern with innate
      immunity and nutrient metabolism transcripts significantly lowered in abundance
      after 24 h of exposure and were higher in abundance after 72 h of recovery. In
      addition, transcription/translation, cellular responses, and DNA repair pathways 
      were significantly impacted after 24 h of exposure and recovered after 72 h of
      recovery. However, histological alterations such as tubule atrophy indicated an
      increase in severity after 24 and 72 h of recovery. The present study provides
      new insights into the sublethal impacts of crude oil exposure in greentail prawns
      and identifies molecular pathways altered by exposure. We expect these findings
      to inform future management associated with oil extraction activity and spills.

LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.928509 [doi]
AB  - In 2019, the United States National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System
      (NARMS) surveyed raw salmon, shrimp, and tilapia from retail grocery outlets in
      eight states to assess the prevalence of bacterial contamination and
      antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the isolates. Prevalence of the targeted
      bacterial genera ranged among the commodities: Salmonella (0%-0.4%), Aeromonas
      (19%-26%), Vibrio (7%-43%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.8%-2.3%), Staphylococcus
      (23%-30%), and Enterococcus (39%-66%). Shrimp had the highest odds (OR: 2.8, CI: 
      2.0-3.9) of being contaminated with at least one species of these bacteria, as
      were seafood sourced from Asia vs. North America (OR: 2.7; CI: 1.8-4.7) and Latin
      America and the Caribbean vs. North America (OR: 1.6; CI: 1.1-2.3) and seafood
      sold at the counter vs. sold frozen (OR: 2.1; CI: 1.6-2.9). Isolates exhibited
      pan-susceptibility (Salmonella and P. aeruginosa) or low prevalence of resistance
      (<10%) to most antimicrobials tested, with few exceptions. Seafood marketed as
      farm-raised had lower odds of contamination with antimicrobial resistant bacteria
      compared to wild-caught seafood (OR: 0.4, CI: 0.2-0.7). Antimicrobial resistance 
      genes (ARGs) were detected for various classes of medically important
      antimicrobials. Clinically relevant ARGs included carbapenemases (bla IMI-2, bla 
      NDM-1) and extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs; bla CTX-M-55). This
      population-scale study of AMR in seafood sold in the United States provided the
      basis for NARMS seafood monitoring, which began in 2020.

AB  - The current study examines the effect of dietary supplementation of ethanolic
      extract of Arthrospira platensis NIOF17/003, which is mainly natural astaxanthins
      (97.50%), on the growth performance, feed utilization, bacterial abundance, and
      immune-related and antioxidant gene expressions of the Pacific white leg shrimp, 
      Litopenaeus vannamei. A total of 360 healthy L. vannamei postlarvae (0.19 +/-
      0.003 g) were divided into four groups (0, 2, 4, and 6 g natural astaxanthins/kg 
      diet) each in three replicates, at an initial density of 30 PLs per tank (40 L
      capacity). The shrimp were fed the tested diets three times a day at a rate of
      10% of their total body weight for 90 days. Diets supplemented with different
      astaxanthin levels significantly improved shrimp growth performance and feed
      conversion ratio compared to the control diet. No significant differences were
      observed in survival rates among all experimental groups. The immune-related
      genes (prophenoloxidase, lysozyme, beta-glucan binding protein, transglutaminase,
      and crustin) mRNA levels were significantly upregulated in groups fed with
      different concentrations of the natural astaxanthins in a dose-dependent manner. 
      The prophenoloxidase gene is the highest immune-upregulated gene (14.71-fold
      change) in response to astaxanthin supplementation. The superoxide dismutase mRNA
      level was significantly increased with increasing dietary astaxanthin
      supplementation. In addition, increasing astaxanthin supplementation levels
      significantly reduced the count of heterotrophic bacteria and Vibrio spp. in the 
      culture water and shrimp intestine. Overall, the current results concluded that
      diet supplementation with natural astaxanthin, extracted from Arthrospira
      platensis, enhanced the growth performance, immune response, and antioxidant
      status of L. vannamei.

AB  - Multitude of diseases and side effects from conventional drugs have surged the
      use of herbal remedies. Thus, the current study aimed to appraise various
      pharmacological attributes of Artemisia brevifolia Wall. ex DC. Extracts prepared
      by successive solvent extraction were subjected to phytochemical and multimode
      antioxidant assays. Various polyphenolics and artemisinin derivatives were
      detected and quantified using RP-HPLC analysis. Compounds present in methanol (M)
      and distilled water (DW) extracts were identified using high resolution mass
      spectrometry (HRMS). Extracts were pharmacologically evaluated for their
      antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial, antileishmanial and antidiabetic
      potentials. Moreover, cytotoxicity against Artemiasalina, human cancer cell lines
      and isolated lymphocytes was assessed. Genotoxicity was evaluated using comet,
      micronucleus and chromosomal aberration assays. Lastly, anti-inflammatory
      potential was determined through a series of in vitro and in vivo assays using
      BALB/c mice. Maximum extract recovery (5.95% w/w) was obtained by DW extract.
      Highest phenolics and flavonoids content, total antioxidant capacity, total
      reduction potential, percentfree radical scavenging, beta-carotene scavenging and
      iron chelating activities were exhibited by M extract. RP-HPLC analysis revealed 
      significant amounts of various polyphenolic compounds (vanillic acid, syringic
      acid, emodin and luteolin), artemisinin, dihydro artemisinin, artesunate and
      artemether in ethyl acetate (EA) extract. Total 40 compounds were detected
      through HRMS. A noteworthy antimicrobial activity (MIC 22.22 microg/ml) was
      exhibited by EA extract against A. fumigatus and several bacterial strains.
      Maximum antimalarial, antileishmanial, brine shrimp lethality and cytotoxic
      potential against cancer cells was manifested by EA extract. None of the extracts
      exhibited genotoxicity and toxicity against isolated lymphocytes. Highest
      alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase inhibition capacities were demonstrated by DW
      extract. Various in-vivo anti-inflammatory models revealed significant (p < 0.05)
      anti-inflammatory potential of M and DW extracts. In conclusion, present findings
      divulged theremarkable pharmacological potential of A. brevifolia and endorse its
      richness in artemisinin.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of the moringa (Moringa oleifera) leaf extract
      and Lactobacillus acidophilus individually or combined on growth performance,
      enzyme activity, intestinal and hepatopancreatic histology, intestinal
      microbiota, immune response, and resistance against Vibrio alginolyticus and
      Vibrio parahaemolyticus in whiteleg shrimp (Penaeus vannamei). Six diets were
      formulated: three diets without L. acidophilus containining 0 (control, ME0), 2.5
      (ME2.5), and 5.0 g/kg of moringa (ME5.0) and the same three diets containing L.
      acidophilus at 1 x 10(7) CFU/g of diet (ME0+P, ME2.5 + P, and ME5.0 + P,
      respectively). Growth performance was measured after 60 days of the rearing
      period. On the final day, the shrimp were sampled to assess enzyme activity,
      intestinal and hepatopancreatic histology, and gut microbiota. Shrimp hemocytes
      were examined on Days 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 to measure the immune
      response in terms of the total hemocyte count, phenoloxidase activity,
      phagocytosis, and superoxide anion production. Furthermore, the shrimp were
      challenged with V. alginolyticus and V. parahaemolyticus. The results revealed
      that ME2.5 + P significantly increased (P < 0.05) final weight, weight gain,
      specific growth rate, enzyme activities, and villi height compared with ME2.5 and
      control. Wall thickness was increased in the shrimp fed diet supplemented with
      moringa and L. acidophilus compared with the control shrimp. Hepatopancreatic
      histology revealed that R cells were more abundant in the shrimp fed diet
      containing moringa and L. acidophilus compared with those fed diet containing
      moringa alone (P < 0.05) at the same concentration. High-throughput sequencing
      analysis indicated that the dietary supplementation with moringa and L.
      acidophilus affected the gut microbiota composition. All gene functions, members 
      of KEGG level 2, related to metabolism were increased in diet supplemented with
      moringa with or without L. acidophilus compared with the control group. The
      immune assay revealed that the total hemocyte count, phenoloxidase activity,
      phagocytic rate, superoxide anion production, and immune-related gene expression 
      (including those of prophenoloxidase II, alpha-2-macroglobulin, penaeidin2,
      antilipopolysaccharide factor, crustin, lysozyme, glutathione peroxidase, and
      superoxide dismutase) were higher in the experimental groups than in the control 
      group on several observed days; however, the increases were observed more often
      in the ME2.5 + P group than in the other treatment groups. Furthermore, the ME2.5
      + P group exhibited a significantly higher survival rate (P < 0.05) in the
      challenge test against V. alginolyticus and V. parahaemolyticus. In conclusion,
      supplementation with dietary moringa and L. acidophilus at ME2.5 + P improved
      growth performance, immune system, and resistance against Vibrio in the shrimp.

AB  - Red seaweeds have several biofunctional properties, including immunomodulatory,
      antitumor, antioxidant, and antibacterial activities. In this study, we examined 
      the effects of diets containing Sarcodia suae on the immune response,
      immune-related gene expressions, and disease resistance against Vibrio
      alginolyticus in white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. In addition, (1)H NMR
      metabolomics was applied to analyze the metabolites extracted from shrimp fed
      with S. suae and their functions in regulating immunity. A diet containing only
      fish meal was used as the control diet (S0), and three diets containing different
      concentrations of S. suae powder, 2.5% (S2.5), 5% (S5), and 7.5% (S7.5) were used
      as experimental diets. Shrimp were fed diets for 20 days. Compared to the control
      group (S0), results showed that (1) shrimp fed diets supplemented with 5-7.5% of 
      S. suae powder signi fi cantly increased anti-V. alginolyticus activity; (2)
      phagocytic activity (PA) increased in all shrimp fed with S. suae, but total
      haemocyte count (THC) only increased in S7.5 group; and (3) the expression of
      glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in haemocyte were significantly higher in S7.5
      groups. Results from the (1)H NMR analysis revealed that 19 heapatopancreatic
      metabolites were matched and identified among groups. Based on the KEGG
      enrichment analysis, the up-regulated metabolites in the shrimp fed S5 and S7.5
      diets were primarily due to the metabolism of purine and phenylalanine and their 
      respective pathways. Results from these trials reveal that diets containing S.
      suae can increase immune response, thereby increasing shrimp resistance to V.
      alginolyticus. The purine and phenylalanine metabolic pathways may be considered 
      as the relevant pathways for optimizing immunomodulatory responses.

AB  - Pollution characteristics and associated ecological risks of PAHs in sediments
      from Brunei Bay, Brunei were investigated. The concentrations of summation
      operator16 PAHs ranged from 826.7 to 2955.3 mug kg(-1), indicating moderate to
      high level of pollution. Source apportionment of PAHs by molecular isomeric
      ratios and positive matrix factorization model indicated impact of potential
      anthropogenic PAH sources including combustion of biomass and fossil fuels. The
      data indicated relatively no significant ecotoxicological risk for most of PAH
      compounds. To estimate the individual c-PAH toxicity, the toxic equivalent
      quantity (c-TEQ) was calculated. Results of the TEQ analysis showed that BaP
      followed by DBA and BaA are the most carcinogenic of PAHs examined in the study
      area. The evaluation of human health risk of PAHs revealed that the cancer risk
      of PAHs for adults and children was higher than the USEPA threshold (<1E-06) and 
      lower than 1E-3, implying low to moderate risk.

TI  - A large geographic-scale characterization of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in 
      surface sediments and multiple aquatic foods of inland freshwater aquaculture
      ponds in China: Co-occurrence, source and risk assessment.

AB  - Inland freshwater aquaculture ponds (IFAPs) represent the key component of the
      global lentic freshwater environment and are increasingly important for global
      aquaculture production, yet the occurrence of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in
      these pond systems remains largely unknown. Here, we characterized the residual
      concentrations of 19 individual OCPs in sediments and in cultured fish and
      crustacean species (crabs, shrimp, crayfish and lobster), which were on-spot
      sampled from the IFAPs at a large region-scale in China. The total OCP levels in 
      sediments varied dramatically between regions. Crabs presented the greatest OCP
      contamination among the studied species. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) 
      was the dominating contaminant in sediments and crabs and its stable degradation 
      products 4,4'-DDE and 4,4'-DDD were co-occurrent between these two compartments. 
      The diagnostic ratio analysis indicated fresh inputs of DDTs, lindane and aldrin 
      in multiple regions, which may be resulted from agricultural soil erosion,
      surface runoff and local anthropogenic activities. Ecological impacts of these
      pesticides could be expected at some sites due to their levels in sediments above
      the risk level. Risk assessment based on the OCP levels corrected by the cooking 
      loss revealed that daily consumption of the IFAPs-derived aquatic foods may pose 
      carcinogenic risks in humans.

      Metalloprotease Production.
LID - 2741 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/polym14132741 [doi]
AB  - This study attempted to use fishery processing wastes to produce protease by
      Paenibacillus elgii TKU051. Of the tested wastes, tuna head powder (THP) was
      found to be the most effective carbon and nitrogen (C/N) source, and the optimal 
      conditions were as follows: 0.811% THP, 0.052% K2HPO4, 0.073% MgSO4, initial pH
      of 8.96, incubation temperature of 31.4 degrees C, and incubation time of 3.092
      days to achieve the maximum protease activity of 2.635 +/- 0.124 U/mL. A protease
      with a molecular weight of 29 kDa was purified and biochemically characterized.
      Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry analysis revealed an amino
      acid sequence of STVHYSTR of P. elgii TKU051 protease, suggesting that the enzyme
      may belong to the M4 family of metalloproteases. The optimal activity of the
      enzyme was achieved at 60 degrees C and pH 8. P. elgii TKU051 protease was
      strongly inhibited by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and 1,10-phenanthroline,
      indicating its precise metalloprotease property. P. elgii TKU051 protease
      displayed the activity toward casein and raw fishery wastes such as tuna heads,
      tuna viscera, shrimp heads, and squid pens. Finally, the purified P. elgii TKU051
      protease could improve the free-radical scavenging activity of fishery wastes. In
      short, P. elgii TKU051 has potential application in eco-friendly approaches to
      efficiently convert fishery wastes to metalloprotease.

LID - 10.3390/foods11131938 [doi]
AB  - The present study focused on the determination of color, flavor, taste, and
      volatile organic compounds (VOCs) changes of shrimp paste fermented for 1, 2, 3, 
      and 8 years by E-nose, E-tongue, and headspace solid-phase microextraction gas
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS). During fermentation, the color 
      of shrimp paste turned dark brown with decreases in L*, a*, and b* values.
      Inorganic sulfide odor was dominant in all fermented samples. The umami,
      richness, and aftertaste-B reached a maximum in year 3 of fermentation. A total
      of 182 volatiles, including long-chain alkanes, esters, aldehydes, olefins,
      ketones, acids, furans, and pyrazines, were detected. Sixteen VOCs including
      dimethyl disulfide, methional, trimethyl-pyrazine, (E,E)-2,4-heptadienal,
      benzeneacetaldehyde were selected as flavor markers. Correlation analysis showed 
      that 94 VOCs were related to saltiness while 40, 17, 21, 22, and 24 VOCs
      contributed to richness, umami, aftertase-B, sourness, and bitterness,
      respectively. These novel data may help in optimizing fermentation duration to
      achieve target flavor indicators in opossum shrimp paste production.

TI  - Widely Targeted Lipidomics and Transcriptomics Analysis Revealed Changes of Lipid
      Metabolism in Spleen Dendritic Cells in Shrimp Allergy.
LID - 1882 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/foods11131882 [doi]
AB  - Shrimp allergy (SA) is pathological type 2 inflammatory immune responses against 
      harmless shrimp protein allergen, which is caused by complex interactions between
      dendritic cells (DCs) and other immune cells. Lipid metabolism in different DCs
      states are significantly changed. However, the lipid metabolism of spleen DCs in 
      SA remain ambiguous. In this study, we established a BALB/c mouse shrimp protein 
      extract-induced allergy model to determine the lipid profile of spleen DCs in SA,
      and the molecular mechanism between lipid metabolism and immune inflammation was 
      preliminarily studied. Spleen DCs were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell
      sorting, and then widely targeted lipidomics and transcriptomics analysis were
      performed. Principal component analysis presented the lipidome alterations in SA.
      The transcriptomic data showed that Prkcg was involved in lipid metabolism,
      immune system, and inflammatory signaling pathway. In the correlation analysis,
      the results suggested that Prkcg was positively correlated with triacylglycerol
      (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.917, p = 0.01). The lipidomics and
      transcriptomics integrated pathway analysis indicated the activated metabolic
      conversion from triacylglycerol to 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol and the transmission of
      lipid metabolism to immune inflammation (from triacylglycerol and ceramide to
      Prkcg) in SA spleen DCs, and cellular experiments in vitro showed that glyceryl
      trioleate and C16 ceramide treatment induced immune function alteration in DCs.

AB  - White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) has been reported to cause severe economic loss 
      in the shrimp industry. With WSSV being a large virus still under investigation, 
      the 3D structure of its assembly remains unclear. The current study was planned
      to clarify the 3D structures of WSSV infections in the cell nucleus of red swamp 
      crayfish (Procambarus clarkii). The samples from various tissues were prepared on
      the seventh day post-infection. The serial sections of the intestinal tissue were
      obtained for electron tomography after the ultrastructural screening. After 3D
      reconstruction, the WSSV-associated structures were further visualized, and the
      expressions of viral proteins were confirmed with immuno-gold labeling. While the
      pairs of sheet-like structures with unknown functions were observed in the
      nucleus, the immature virions could be recognized by the core units of
      nucleocapsids on a piece of the envelope. The maturation of the particle could
      include the elongation of core units and the filling of empty nucleocapsids with 
      electron-dense materials. Our observations may bring to light a possible order of
      WSSV maturation in the cell nucleus of the crayfish, while more investigations
      remain necessary to visualize the detailed viral-host interactions.

LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-21731-8 [doi]
AB  - To evaluate the pollution level and health risk of total petroleum hydrocarbon
      (TPH), seawater, sediments, and aquatic organisms were sampled from the southern 
      sea area of Zhejiang Province (Yangtze River Delta, China) between 2017 and 2019.
      TPH was widely present in the aquatic environment and products, and its
      concentration was highly variable. The average value of pollution index (PI)
      exceeded 1 from 2017 to 2018, and 45.46-69.19% of seawater samples and
      56.87-50.00% of sediment samples were polluted. The results showed significant
      differences in the TPH concentration in various species of aquatic organisms. The
      average TPH value in aquatic organisms could be ranked in the order as follows:
      bivalve > shrimp > crab > fish, further reflecting that the ability to accumulate
      and metabolize TPH existed differently among aquatic organisms within the same
      pond aquaculture environment. It was relatively safe to eat aquatic products
      since the exposure risk index was found to be far below the threshold value in
      this study. Therefore, it would be prudent to undertake regular monitoring of TPH
      to ensure effective ecosystem functioning and seafood safety in the southern
      Zhejiang ocean.

AB  - Astaxanthin (3,3'-dihydroxy-beta,beta-carotene-4,4'-dione) is an orange-red,
      lipophilic keto-carotenoid pigment. It is majorly found in marine ecosystems
      particularly in aquatic animals such as salmon, shrimp, trout, krill, crayfish,
      and so on. It is also synthesized in microalgae Heamatococcus pluvialis,
      Chlorococcum, Chlorella zofingiensis, red yeast Phaffia rhodozyma and bacterium
      Paracoccus carotinifaciens. Some aquatic and terrestrial creatures regarded as a 
      primary and secondary sources of the astaxanthin producing and accumulating it
      through their metabolic pathways. Astaxanthin is the powerful antioxidant,
      nutritional supplement as well as promising therapeutic compound, observed to
      have activities against different ravaging diseases and disorders. Researchers
      have reported remarkable bioactivities of astaxanthin against major
      non-communicable chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer,
      diabetes, neurodegenerative, and immune disorders. The current review discusses
      some structural aspects of astaxanthin. It further elaborates its multiple
      potencies such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative,
      anti-cancer, anti-obese, anti-diabetic, anti-ageing, anti-TB, anti-viral,
      anti-COVID 19, neuro-protective, nephro-protective, and fertility-enhancing
      properties. These potencies make it a more precious entity in the preventions as 
      well as treatments of prevalent systematic diseases and/or disorders. Also, the
      review is acknowledging and documenting its powerful bioactivities in relation
      with the pharmaceutical as well as nutraceutical applicability.

AB  - The growth performance, immunological status, and intestinal microbiology of
      white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, were evaluated after dietary administration
      of the commercial probiotic SYNSEA. Shrimp were fed a control diet (without
      probiotic supplement) and two levels of SYNSEA probiotic, a low concentration of 
      SYNSEA (LSL) containing 10(5) CFU (g diet)(-1)Bacillus subtilis and 10(5) CFU (g 
      diet)(-1) lactic acid bacteria (LAB), and a high concentration of SYNSEA (LSH)
      containing 10(6) CFU (g diet)(-1)B. subtilis and 10(6) CFU (g diet)(-1) LAB, for 
      12 weeks. Shrimp fed with the LSL diet significantly increased growth performance
      as well as final weight and feed efficiency compared to the control, but not the 
      LSH diet. After being orally challenged with Vibrio parahaemolyticus, shrimp fed 
      with LSL diet prior to the challenge or fed with LSL and pathogen simultaneously 
      showed significantly lower mortality compared to the control. SYNSEA probiotic
      significantly improved shrimp immune response, including lysozyme activity in LSL
      and LSH groups, and phagocytic activity in the LSL group in comparison to the
      control. In addition, the gene expressions of anti-lipopolysaccharide factor 2 in
      LSL and LSH groups, and penaeidin 4 in LSL were also up-regulated. Although there
      was no significant difference among groups for hepatopancreas and intestinal
      morphology, the muscular layer thickness and villi height were slightly improved 
      in the intestines of shrimp fed SYNSEA. The 16S rDNA gene amplicon sequence
      analysis using next-generation sequencing revealed a significant decrease in
      alpha-diversity (Margalef's species richness) after oral administration of SYNSEA
      due to an increase in the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria in the gut
      flora of shrimp, such as Lactobacillus, Shewanella, and Bradymonadales and a
      decrease in harmful bacteria, such as Vibrio, Candidatus_Berkiella, and
      Acinetobacter baumannii. Together the data suggest that the provision of SYNSEA
      probiotic at 10(5) CFU (g diet)(-1)B. subtilis and 10(5) CFU (g diet)(-1) LAB can
      improve shrimp growth, enhance immunity, and disease resistance status of the
      host. In addition, these findings conclude that SYNSEA probiotic has great
      preventive and therapeutic potential for Vibrio infection in shrimp aquaculture.

TI  - Snapping shrimp have helmets that protect their brains by dampening shock waves.
LID - S0960-9822(22)01004-1 [pii]

AB  - Shock waves are supersonic high-amplitude pressure waves that cause barotrauma
      when they transfer kinetic energy to the tissues of animals.(1-4) Snapping shrimp
      (Alpheidae) produce shock waves and are exposed to them frequently, so we asked
      if these animals have evolved mechanisms of physical protection against them.
      Snapping shrimp generate shock waves by closing their snapping claws rapidly
      enough to form cavitation bubbles that release energy as an audible "snap" and a 
      shock wave when they collapse.(5-8) We tested if snapping shrimp are protected
      from shock waves by a helmet-like extension of their exoskeleton termed the
      orbital hood. Using behavioral trials, we found shock wave exposure slowed
      shelter-seeking and caused a loss of motor control in Alpheus heterochaelis from 
      which we had removed orbital hoods but did not significantly affect behavior in
      shrimp with unaltered orbital hoods. Shock waves thus have the potential to harm 
      snapping shrimp but may not do so under natural conditions because of protection 
      provided to shrimp by their orbital hoods. Using pressure recordings, we
      discovered the orbital hoods of A. heterochaelis dampen shock waves. Sealing the 
      anterior openings of orbital hoods diminished how much they altered the
      magnitudes of shock waves, which suggests these helmet-like structures dampen
      shock waves by trapping and expelling water so that kinetic energy is redirected

      mitigate blast-induced neurotrauma in snapping shrimp by dampening shock waves,
      making them the first biological armor system known to have such a function.

AB  - This study investigated the synergistic effects of oxolinic acid (OA) combined
      with oxytetracycline (OTC) on white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei). Disk diffusion
      susceptibility testing was performed to analyze the sensitivity of Vibrio
      alginolyticus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus to different concentrations of OA and
      OTC. The results revealed that 50 mg OA/L combined with 50 mg OTC/L exhibited
      stronger antibacterial effects on V. alginolyticus and V. parahaemolyticus. The
      results of in vitro tests indicated that cotreatment with OA and OTC
      significantly reduced superoxide anion production and phenoloxidase activity, but
      not phagocytic activity. Subsequently, feeding trials were performed to
      investigate the immunomodulatory effects and bioaccumulation of dietary OA
      combined with OTC on shrimp. The healthy shrimp (15.13 +/- 1.02 g) were divided
      into four groups: control, 100 mg OA/kg combined with 50 mg OTC/kg, 50 mg OA/kg
      combined with 100 mg OTC/kg, and 50 mg OA/kg combined with 50 mg OTC/kg. The
      shrimp were sampled to determine innate immunity parameters and residual OA and
      OTC levels in the muscle during a 28-day feeding regimen; the shrimp were fed the
      experimental diet from day 1 to day 5 and a commercial diet from day 6 to day 28.
      Residual OA levels were considerably higher in the group fed 100 mg OA/kg
      combined with 50 mg OTC/kg compared with the other groups and peaked on day 4.
      The residual OA levels of all the groups were below the detection limit after
      without providing OA. The residual OTC levels of the group fed 50 mg OA/kg
      combined with 100 mg OTC/kg were considerably higher from day 1 to day 4. The
      residual OTC levels in all the groups decreased rapidly and could not be detected
      on day 28. The administration of 50 mg OA/kg combined with 100 mg OTC/kg exerted 
      the least effect on the white shrimp. Moreover, the survival rates of the
      treatment groups after the V. parahaemolyticus challenge were higher than those
      of the control group, especially the group fed 50 mg OA/kg combined with 100 mg
      OTC/kg. This result indicated that the synergistic effects of dietary OA and OTC 
      are safe and effective. Combination therapy is a new method of antibiotic use in 
      aquaculture.

TI  - Epidemiological and Whole-Genome Sequencing Analysis of a Gastroenteritis
      Outbreak Caused by a New Emerging Serotype of Vibrio parahaemolyticus in China.
LID - 10.1089/fpd.2022.0002 [doi]
AB  - Vibrio parahaemolyticus is an important foodborne pathogen with diverse
      serotypes. In May 2021, we investigated a gastroenteritis outbreak that occurred 
      in China, caused by V. parahaemolyticus O10:K4 infection. Based on the
      epidemiological curve, this outbreak was identified as a homologous exposure
      event. A case-control study demonstrated that emperor crab with mashed garlic
      (odds ratio [OR] = 4.60, p = 0.030; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]:
      1.11-19.14), goose liver geoduck (OR = 4.50, p = 0.029; 95% CI: 1.12-18.13),
      shrimp (OR = 4.89, p = 0.021; 95% CI: 1.22-19.65), and sea cucumber (OR = 7.36, p
      = 0.005; 95% CI: 1.68-32.26) were the potential sources of the food poisoning. V.
      parahaemolyticus isolates from 18 laboratory-confirmed cases were all serotyped
      O10:K4, and determined to be sequence type ST3 via multilocus sequence typing.
      Pulsed field gel electrophoresis and whole-genome sequencing analysis revealed
      the identical pattern and 0-2 single nucleotide variation among these isolates.
      tdh was positive in all isolates, while trh and Orf8 were absent. Seven essential
      base positions in toxRS for pandemic clone identification were identical between 
      the O10:K4 and O3:K6 pandemic clones. Phylogenetic analysis with 45 additional
      genomes of 13 different serotypes showed the closest genetic relationship between
      O10:K4 and O1: KUT. O10:K4 was thought to evolve from the O3:K6 pandemic clone.
      The new serovariant of O3:K6 poses a challenge for the prevention and control of 
      V. parahaemolyticus disease outbreaks, or even epidemics, in the future.

TI  - Microplastic contamination in wild shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei from the
      Huizache-Caimanero Coastal lagoon, SE Gulf of California.

AB  - We identified and characterized microplastics (MPs) in the gastrointestinal tract
      (GT), gills (GI), and exoskeleton (EX) of Litopenaeus vannamei in a coastal
      lagoon from the SE Gulf of California. The most common MPs were fibers and
      fragments with an average size of 403 +/- 296 mum, in which the transparent and
      blue colors predominated. The abundance (items/g as wet weight (ww)) in the GT,
      GI, and EX was 114.7 +/- 33.2, 13.7 +/- 5.3 and 3.0 +/- 0.5, respectively. The
      abundance of MPs per shrimp was 13.3 +/- 1.1, while the abundance per individual 
      (ww) was 0.9 +/- 0.2 MPs/g. Considering the consumption of shrimp in Mexico, MP
      abundance, and shrimp consumption (discarding GI and EX), we estimated MP
      ingestion as 280 items/person/year. The results from this study can be used as
      background information for future MP biomonitoring in shrimp species of
      ecological and commercial importance.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the sensitization characteristics and change of major
      allergens in children from 2010 to 2020 in Beijing, so as to provide basis for
      diagnosis, treatment and prevention of allergic diseases in children. Methods: A 
      retrospective study was conducted to analyze the children who were suspected of
      allergic diseases and tested for serum immunoglobulin E (total IgE and specific
      IgE) in the children's Hospital Affiliated to the Capital Institute of Pediatrics
      from January 2010 to December 2020. A total of 45 746 children aged 0-17 years in
      Beijing were enrolled with a median (interquartile range) of 3.8 (2.5, 5.3)
      years. There were 28 918 boys (63.2%) and 16 828 girls (36.8%) and 14 984 cases
      (32.8%) in the infant group (<3 years old), 22 049 cases (48.2%) in the preschool
      group (3-6 years old), and 8 713 cases (19.0%) in the school-age group (6 years
      old and above). Immunocap allergen detection system (fluorescence enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay) was used to detect and the characteristics and change trend 
      of allergens during 11 years were statistically analyzed by Chi square test.
      Results: The top three positive rates of single food allergens sIgE were egg
      white 42.6% (2 788/6 577 tests), milk 38.4% (2 606/6 782 tests) and wheat 31.8%
      (1 417/4 449 tests), and the sequence of single inhaled allergens were Ragweed
      42.6% (440/1 034 tests), Artemisia 38.4% (1 045/3 191 tests) and Alternaria
      alternata 31.3% (3 358/10 725 tests). The positive detection rates of egg white
      47.0%(1 904/4 048 tests), milk 41.9%(1 769/4 226 tests) and wheat 33.9%(973/2 870
      tests) in the infant group were the highest, and there have statistically
      significant(chi(2)=91.495, 73.907, 16.966, P<0.05). The positive rates of fx1
      (22.5%, 121/537 tests), peanut (24.9%, 111/446 tests), soybean (20.0%, 74/370
      tests) and shrimp (7.48%, 44/588 tests) were the highest in the school-age
      group(chi(2)=14.436, 10.751, 11.569, 13.703, P<0.05). The most common inhaled
      allergens were Alternaria alternata (14.8%, 422/2 859 tests) in the infant group,
      Ambrosia (34.5%, 143/415 tests) and Alternaria alternata (33.5%, 1 762/5 254
      tests) in the preschool group, while in the school-age group were Ambrosia
      (56.4%, 282/500 tests) and Artemisia (48.2%, 573/1 189 tests). The positive rates
      of egg white, milk, wheat, sesame seed and peanut varied from 2010 to 2020,
      showing a trend of falling first and then
      rising(chi(2)=10.293,chi(2)=12.066,chi(2)=7.402,chi(2)=32.458,chi(2)=31.747,P<0.0
      5).The positive detection rates of soybean showed a significant downward trend
      (21.4%, 173/809 tests in 2010, 15.4%, 70/455 tests in 2020,
      chi(2)=6.751,P=0.009), while that of shrimp and crab were at a stable low
      level(chi(2)=0.263, 1.346;P>0.05). From 2010 to 2020, mold (26.7%, 1 066/3 998
      tests in 2010, 40.2% 1 705/4 243 tests in 2020), grass pollen (19.8%, 259/1 308
      tests in 2010, 39.3%, 1 472/3 746 tests in 2020), tree pollen(17%, 180/1 058
      tests in 2010, 29.8%, 916/3 075 tests in 2020) and animal dander (18.5%, 111/601 
      tests in 2010, 26.6%, 672/2 522 tests in 2020) were all showed significant upward
      trend (chi(2)=168.600, 163.601, 65.931 and 17.271 respectively, P<0.001) but dust
      mites (30.7%, 1 270/4 132 tests in 2010, 26.7%, 1 126/4 221 tests in 2020) showed
      a significant downward trend(chi(2)=16.822,P<0.001).In 2010, the most common
      inhaled allergen was dust mite 30.7% (1 270/4 132 tests), followed by mold 26.7% 
      (1 066/3 998 tests), while they were mold 40.2% (1 705/1 243 tests), and grass
      pollen 39.3% (1 472/3 746 texts) respectively in 2020. Conclusion: In the past 11
      years, the main food allergens in children were still egg white and milk, wheat, 
      but the mold and pollen gradually replaced dust mite as the most common inhaled
      allergen.

AB  - There is not a single species that does not strive for survival. Every species
      has crafted specialized techniques to avoid possible dangers that mostly come
      from the side of their predators. Survival instincts in nature led prey
      populations to develop many anti-predator strategies. Vigilance is a
      well-observed effective antipredator strategy that influences predator-prey
      dynamics significantly. We consider a simple discrete-time predator-prey model
      assuming that vigilance affects the predation rate and the growth rate of the
      prey. We investigate the system dynamics by constructing isoperiodic and Lyapunov
      exponent diagrams with the simultaneous variation of the prey's growth rate and
      the strength of vigilance. We observe a series of different types of organized
      periodic structures with different kinds of period-adding phenomena. The usual
      period-bubbling phenomenon is shown near a shrimp-shaped periodic structure. We
      observe the presence of double and triple heterogeneous attractors. We also
      notice Wada basin boundaries in the system, which is quite rare in ecological
      systems. The complex dynamics of the system in biparameter space are explored
      through extensive numerical simulations.

AB  - Freshwater decapod crustaceans are often ecologically important keystone species 
      in their habitats. The freshwater hillstream decapods of Shenzhen City,
      Guangdong, China, were systematically surveyed for the first time from June to
      September 2019. We identified a total of 19 decapod species from 10 genera and
      six families. Of these, one Macrobrachium species and one potamid species could
      not be assigned to any known species. The latter clearly belongs to the monotypic
      genus Megapleonum Huang, Shih & Ahyong, 2018, and resembles the type species M.
      ehuangzhang in general external morphology. Striking differences in male
      gonopodal morphology along with genetic evidence based on mitochondrial 16S rDNA 
      sequences strongly suggest that this species is distinct from the type species
      and it is herein described as Megapleonum shenzhen n. sp. Our survey data sheds
      light on the biodiversity of hillstream decapods in Shenzhen and highlights areas
      of conservation interest.

      virtual screening.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0269563 [doi]
AB  - SARS-CoV-2 causes the current global pandemic coronavirus disease 2019.
      Widely-available effective drugs could be a critical factor in halting the
      pandemic. The main protease (3CLpro) plays a vital role in viral replication;
      therefore, it is of great interest to find inhibitors for this enzyme. We applied
      the combination of virtual screening based on molecular docking derived from the 
      crystal structure of the peptidomimetic inhibitors (N3, 13b, and 11a), and
      experimental verification revealed FDA-approved drugs that could inhibit the
      3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2. Three drugs were selected using the binding energy criteria
      and subsequently performed the 3CLpro inhibition by enzyme-based assay. In
      addition, six common drugs were also chosen to study the 3CLpro inhibition. Among
      these compounds, lapatinib showed high efficiency of 3CLpro inhibition (IC50
      value of 35 +/- 1 muM and Ki of 23 +/- 1 muM). The binding behavior of lapatinib 
      against 3CLpro was elucidated by molecular dynamics simulations. This drug could 
      well bind with 3CLpro residues in the five subsites S1', S1, S2, S3, and S4.
      Moreover, lapatinib's key chemical pharmacophore features toward SAR-CoV-2 3CLpro
      shared important HBD and HBA with potent peptidomimetic inhibitors. The rational 
      design of lapatinib was subsequently carried out using the obtained results. Our 
      discovery provides an effective repurposed drug and its newly designed analogs to
      inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro.

      Homologs.
PG  - 909410
LID - 10.3389/falgy.2022.909410 [doi]
AB  - Background: Protease resistance is considered a risk factor for allergenicity of 
      proteins, although the correlation is low. It is nonetheless a part of the
      weight-of-evidence approach, proposed by Codex, for assessing the allergenicity
      risk of novel food proteins. Susceptibility of proteins to pepsin is commonly
      tested with purified protein in solution. Objective: Food proteins are rarely
      consumed in purified form. Our aim was to evaluate the impact of experimental and
      endogenous food matrices on protease susceptibility of homologous protein pairs
      with different degrees of allergenicity. Methods: Porcine and shrimp tropomyosin 
      (ST) were subjected to sequential exposure to amylase, pepsin, and pancreatin in 
      their respective endogenous matrix (pork tenderloin/boiled shrimp) and in three
      different experimental matrices (dessert mousse [DM], soy milk [SM], and
      chocolate bar [CB]). Digestion was monitored by immunoblotting using
      tropomyosin-specific antibodies. Recombinant peach and strawberry lipid transfer 
      protein were biotinylated, spiked into both peach and strawberry fruit pulp, and 
      subjected to the same sequential digestion protocol. Digestion was monitored by
      immunoblotting using streptavidin for detection. Results: Chocolate bar, and to a
      lesser extent SM, had a clear protective effect against pepsin digestion of
      porcine tropomyosin (PT) and to a lesser extent of ST. Increased resistance was
      associated with increased protein content. Spiking experiments with bovine serum 
      albumin (BSA) confirmed the protective effect of a protein-rich matrix. The two
      tropomyosins were both highly resistant to pepsin in their protein-rich and lean 
      native food matrix. Pancreatin digestion remained rapid and complete, independent
      of the matrix. The fat-rich environment did not transfer protection against
      pepsin digestion. Spiking of recombinant peach and strawberry lipid transfer
      proteins into peach and strawberry pulp did not reveal any differential
      protective effect that could explain differences in allergenicity of both fruits.
      Conclusions: Protein-rich food matrices delay pepsin digestion by saturating the 
      protease. This effect is most apparent for proteins that are highly pepsin
      susceptible in solution. The inclusion of food matrices does not help in
      understanding why some proteins are strong primary sensitizers while homologs are
      very poor allergens. Although for induction of symptoms in food allergic patients
      (elicitation), a protein-rich food matrix that may contribute to increased risk, 
      our results indicate that the inclusion of food matrices in the
      weight-of-evidence approach for estimating the potential risks of novel proteins 
      to become allergens (sensitization), is most likely of very limited value.

      kuruma shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus.
LID - 10.1111/tbed.14647 [doi]
AB  - Providencia rettgeri has been recognized as a zoonotic pathogen of humans and
      aquaculture animals and has become a global public health concern. However,
      scarce information is available on the characterization of pathogenic P. rettgeri
      from kuruma shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus. In the present study, a P. rettgeri
      isolate (KM4) was confirmed as a causative agent of red leg disease in cultured
      M. japonicus, which showed a median lethal dose (LD50 ) value of 5.01 x 10(5)
      CFU.ml(-1) and had multiple resistances to aminoglycosides, sulfonamides, and
      tetracycline antimicrobials used in aquaculture. In addition, the whole genome of
      isolate KM4 was sequenced and found to consist of a single circular chromosome of
      4,378,712 bp and a circular plasmid of 171,394 bp. The genome sequence analysis
      further revealed the presence of potential virulence and antibiotic resistance
      genes in isolate KM4, which probably rendered this isolate particularly virulent.
      To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterize P. rettgeri pathogens
      from kuruma shrimp infected with red leg disease. The findings of this study can 
      provide novel insights into the presence and distribution of
      pathogenicity-associated genes in shrimp-pathogenic P. rettgeri.

AB  - White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is extremely pathogenic and causes huge economic
      losses in the shrimp farming industry. Neutralizing antibodies against WSSV is
      expected to be an effective means of preventing infection with the virus. In the 
      present study, eight monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against VP28 were developed by 
      immunizing BALB/c mice with WSSV-VP28 recombinant protein. Among them, three mAbs
      named 3B7, 2G3 and 5D2 were determined to be able to delay the mortality of
      WSSV-infected shrimp in vivo neutralization assay, suggesting their neutralizing 
      ability against WSSV infection. Immunoblotting results showed that the three mAbs
      reacted specifically with native VP28 of WSSV, and could also recognize the
      virions in the gills of WSSV-infected shrimp by IFA. Furthermore, the single
      chain variable fragment (scFv) genes specific for WSSV-VP28 were cloned from the 
      three hybridoma cells and expressed in Escherichia coli. After purification and
      refolding, three biologically active scFv recombinant proteins were all capable
      of recognizing the native VP28 of WSSV and delayed the mortality of WSSV-infected
      shrimp, indicating their neutralizing capacity against WSSV. Subsequently, the
      eukaryotic expression plasmids of three scFv genes were constructed and the
      transcriptional properties of expression vectors in shrimp were analyzed. Animal 
      experiments also proved that the scFv eukaryotic expression plasmids were able to
      partially neutralize WSSV infection. Thus, the production of neutralizing mAb and
      recombinant scFv antibodies against WSSV has a promising therapeutic potential in
      prevention and treatment of white spot disease of shrimp.

AB  - An effervescence-assisted dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction approach using
      three-component deep eutectic solvent based on short-chain and medium-chain
      carboxylic acids and terpenoid was developed for the first time. The
      microextraction procedure was applied to the determination of fluoroquinolone
      antibiotics in foods (milk and shrimp samples) by high-performance liquid
      chromatography with fluorometric detection. In this microextraction procedure
      three-component deep eutectic solvent acted as a proton donor agent and an
      extractant. The carbon dioxide bubbles caused by the fast reaction between
      precursor of deep eutectic solvent (short-chain carboxylic acid) and effervescent
      agent (sodium carbonate) promoted the dispersion of the extractant in an aqueous 
      sample phase. Various carboxylic acids were studied as hydrogen bond donors for
      the formation of deep eutectic solvents and proton donor agents for the
      generation of CO2 bubbles. Two natural terpenoids (menthol and thymol) were
      studied as the hydrogen bond acceptors for the formation of three-component
      solvent. The extraction system based on heptanoic acid and thymol (1:2, mol/mol) 
      containing formic acid (proton donor for generating CO2 bubbles) provided maximum
      extraction recovery (86-99%) and a higher extraction efficiency of analytes
      compared to their extraction into individual hydrophobic precursors of the
      system. The LODs, calculated from the blank tests based on 3sigma, were varied
      from 0.03 to 0.06 mug L(-1) and from 0.3 to 0.6 mug kg(-1) for fluoroquinolone
      antibiotics in milk and shrimp samples, respectively. The proposed approach
      provided effective dispersion of extractant speeding up the extraction process
      and fast separation of phases without any external energy assistance.

AB  - In the present study, sarcoplasmic calcium-binding protein (SCP) was first
      expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3), and then identified based on immunoblotting and 
      SCP amino acid sequencing of shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) using mass
      spectrometry (MS). The recombinant SCP (rSCP) was treated with different
      temperature conditions to investigate its immunological properties, in vitro
      digestibility and structural changes with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
      (ELISA), immunoblotting, spectrophotometry and molecular dynamics simulation
      techniques. The immunoglobulin (Ig) E-binding activity of the rSCP could remain
      stable until 80 degrees C, whereas the higher thermal processing temperatures
      resulted in a significant decrease in IgG/IgE-binding capacity coupled with
      alterations in the secondary and tertiary structures. Notably, the maximum
      reduction of IgG/IgE reactivity and in vitro digestibility were observed in the
      autoclaved rSCP. The decrease in the potential allergenicity of rSCP not only
      correlated well with the decreasing of alpha-helix, epitopes masking and exposure
      of more protease cleavage sites, but also with the destruction of Ca(2+) binding 
      sites due to the unfolding of the rSCP with heating treatments, which was
      supported by the thermal-induced changes of the secondary and tertiary
      structures. These findings indicate that autoclaved treatment may be an effective
      and promising approach for producing hypoallergenic seafood.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Terasi is a fermented shrimp paste unique to Indonesia and is used 
      in dishes to add umami and saltiness. In a previous study, the controlled
      fermentation of terasi was optimized using starters containing three bacterial
      isolates: Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Bacillus subtilis, and Lactobacillus
      murinus. However, the influence of controlled fermentation using these starters
      on the metabolites in terasi has not yet been studied. OBJECTIVES: Therefore,
      this study aimed to investigate the effect of controlled fermentation on
      taste-related metabolites in terasi using a metabolomics approach. RESULTS:
      Non-targeted analysis indicated that amino acids contributed to variations during
      fermentation. Subsequently, targeted analysis of amino acids revealed that terasi
      subjected to controlled fermentation using a starter with a 2:1:2 ratio of S.
      saprophyticus, B. subtilis, and L. murinus, respectively, resulted in a product
      containing D-amino acids, such as D-Asp, D-Gln, and D-Leu that was unique when
      compared to other terasi products prepared using controlled fermentation. Genetic
      analysis of isolates from the terasi produced using controlled fermentation was
      also carried out, and this is the first study to suggest that Staphylococcus spp.
      has the potential to produce D-amino acids. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the ratio 
      of bacterial species in starter cultures used in controlled fermentation
      influenced the amino acid profile of the product and starters with a higher ratio
      of Staphylococcus spp. may result in the production of D-amino acids.

AB  - Infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV) is the smallest
      known virus in shrimp, which causes runt-deformity syndrome (RDS) and leads to
      huge economic loss every year in penaeid shrimp farming. Previous studies have
      shown that the juvenile Penaeus vannamei is more susceptible to IHHNV infection
      than the adults, but the mechanism is still unclear. In order to investigate the 
      mechanism of pathogenic differences in IHHNV infection of P. vannamei at
      different developmental stages, the juvenile and adult P. vannamei were studied
      by transcriptome high-throughput sequencing to analyze their response to IHHNV
      infection. GO and KEGG enrichment were analyzed to search for differentially
      expressed genes (DEGs) related to immunity, growth and metabolism. The results
      showed that many immune-related genes of the juvenile and adult P. vannamei
      responded differently to IHHNV infection. For the adult P. vannamei, the
      expression of most immune-related genes was significantly up-regulated, which
      means that a cellular defense response was triggered after IHHNV infection.
      However, most immune-related genes in juvenile P. vannamei were inhibited,
      indicating that the immune system of juvenile the P. vannamei is imperfect and
      makes it to be more susceptible to IHHNV. Similarly, the growth-related genes of 
      P. vannamei were changed during IHHNV infection. For the juvenile P. vannamei,
      the growth-related genes were significantly down-regulated, which resulted in a
      growth hormone disorder and prevented the juvenile P. vannamei from growth. In
      the adult P. vannamei, most molting-related genes were significantly
      up-regulated, indicating that IHHNV infection leads the adult P. vannamei to
      early molting to eliminate pathogen in the body. Metabolic process data showed
      that energy metabolism pathway was affected when P. vannamei infected with IHHNV.
      The adult P. vannamei infected with IHHNV can cause energetically costly and lead
      to the disturbance of the metabolism, activate complex immune systems to resist
      the invasion of pathogens. The results of this study clarified the response
      mechanism of P. vannamei at different developmental stages to IHHNV infection,
      which can provide new insights to IHHNV effective control and a reference for the
      study of sensitive period of different shrimp virus to host infection.

AB  - The threat of contamination with toxic metals (TMs) to food security and human
      health has become a high priority in recent decades. Hence, countless studies
      have investigated the safe cultivation of rice and fish, respectively, as the
      main food crop and protein source worldwide. For the present study, a literature 
      search of the PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and China National Knowledge
      Infrastructure databases identified 11 studies that met the inclusion criteria
      and provided sufficient data to assess the relationship between TM contamination 
      of rice, fish, and shrimp products from rice-fish co-culture systems and
      carcinogenic risk (CR) and non-carcinogenic risk (non-CR) to humans. The result
      showed that consumption of Monopterus albus and rice contaminated with a single
      TM had a slight non-CR, which is synergistically increased by multiple TMs.
      Consumption of Procambarus clarkii posed no non-CR to humans. The CR of all
      studies ranged from 1.77 x 10(-10) to 5.65 x 10(-8), and less than 1 x 10(-6),
      indicating that under current food safety guidelines, rice and fish produced by
      rice-fish co-culture systems pose no CR. Rice-fish co-culture systems can greatly
      reduce the CR and non-CR of TMs to humans.

AB  - Phytochemicals are directly involved in therapeutic treatment or precursors to
      synthesize useful drugs. The current study was aimed to evaluate the
      phytocompounds and their biopotentials using methanolic and n-hexane extracts of 
      various parts of Oxalis pes-caprae. For the phytochemical analysis, standard
      procedures were used, whereas Aluminum Chloride reagent and Follin-ciocalteau
      reagent methods were used to determine total flavonoid and phenolic contents.
      Radical scavenging DPPH, phosphomolybdenum reduction, and reducing power assays
      were used to assess antioxidative potentials. Antibacterial potential was
      determined by applying disc diffusion method while cytotoxicity was determined
      employing brine shrimp assay. FT-IR (Fourier-transform infrared) analysis was
      utilized to gather spectral information, while molecular docking tools were
      employed to look at how O. pes-caprae plant-based ligands interact with the
      target protein COVID-19 3CLPro (PDB:6LU7). Phenols, flavonoids, alkaloids and
      saponins were tested positive in preliminary phytochemical studies. TPC and TFC
      in different extracts ranging from (38.55 +/- 1.72) to (65.68 +/- 0.88) mg/g
      GAE/g and (24.75 +/- 1.80) to (14.83 +/- 0.92) mg/g QUE/g were used respectively.
      IC50 value (24.75 +/- 0.76 g/mL) by OXFH, total antioxidant capacity (55.89 +/-
      1.75) mg/g by OXLM, reducing potential (34.98 +/- 1.089) mg/g by OXSM, maximum
      zone of inhibition against B. subtilis (24 +/- 0.65 mm) by OXLM and maximum
      cytotoxicity 96% with LD50 19.66 (mug/mL) by OXSM were the best calculated values
      among all extracts. Using molecular docking, it was found that Caeruleanone A,
      2',4'-Dihydroxy-2''-(1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl) dihydrofuro [2,3-h] flavanone and
      Vadimezan demonstrated best affinity with the investigated SARS CoV-2 Mpro
      protein. This work provide justification about this plant as a source of
      effective phytochemicals and their potential against microbes could lead to
      development of biosafe drugs for the welfare of human being. In future, different
      in vitro and in vivo biological studies can be performed to further investigate
      its biomedical potentials.

TI  - Fe(iii) and Cr(vi) ions' removal using AgNPs/GO/chitosan nanocomposite as an
      adsorbent for wastewater treatment.
PG  - 17065-17084

AB  - Heavy metal ions in water refer to significant risks to the biological system due
      to their high toxicity. Therefore, the decontamination of water polluted by heavy
      metal ions attracts significant interest of researchers. Adsorption by
      nanomaterials has been a widely used technique for removing heavy metal ions from
      water. Chitosan was extracted from shrimp shellfish and mixed with
      laboratory-prepared AgNPs/GO in the ratio of 3 : 1. A series of tests evaluates
      the best condition of pH, amount of adsorbent, retention time, stirring speed,
      temp, and initial concentration. The research was conducted under various
      conditions. Langmuir, Freundlich, Tempkin, and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherms
      were also tested. Also, the column adsorption experiment was carried out on
      industrial wastewater at different flow rates and column bed heights. The optimal
      values of the contact time, pH, and adsorbent dose of Cr(vi) were found to be 80 
      min, 4, and 0.1 g 100 mL(-1), respectively, at room temperature (30 degrees C),
      agitation at 150 rpm, and initial concentration of 50 ppm. On the other hand, the
      optimal value of contact time, pH, and adsorbent dose of Fe(iii) were found to be
      30 min, 6, and 0.02 g 100 mL(-1), respectively, at room temp (30 degrees C) with 
      a stirring speed of 250 rpm and an initial concentration of 40 ppm. For Cr(vi)
      and Fe(iii), equilibrium studies show that the data fit the Freundlich isotherm
      well (correlation coefficient, R (2) = 0.98) (III). A link between the
      pseudo-second order active model and data fitting the pseudo-first order active
      models were made. Within the intraparticle diffusion model, there are four stages
      that the mechanism must go through before it is at equilibrium. The adsorbent was
      tested in an industrial adsorbent column. This test proves that the
      nanocomposite's adsorption capacity can be restored by washing it with 0.1 M HCl,
      as shown by the periodicity test. After four cycles, the amount of Cr(vi)
      adsorbed on AgNPs/GO/chitosan was just 20%, which is insufficient for further
      adsorption experiments. Cr(vi) removal rates (%R) decreased slightly.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) play important roles in host innate immune systems.
      Anti-lipopolysaccharide factor (ALF), which is a primary AMP in crustaceans, is
      active against bacteria, fungi and some viruses. MjALF-D, an anionic peptide, is 
      a group D ALF isolated from Marsupenaeus japonicus. In the present study, a
      series of experiments were performed to study its antibacterial spectrum and
      further explore its antibacterial and bacterial binding activities. Liquid growth
      inhibition data demonstrated that recombinant MjALF-D (rMjALF-D) possessed strong
      antibacterial activity against the gram-positive bacterium Micrococcus luteus and
      the gram-negative bacterium Photobacterium damselae, with a minimum inhibitory
      concentration (MIC) or minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) lower than 1.25
      muM. The kinetic analysis showed that the antibacterial activity of rMjALF-D was 
      dose- and time-dependent. Additionally, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
      transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations the potential bactericidal
      process. rMjALF-D treatment resulted in a large number of unidentified
      filamentous structures wrapped around the bacteria, and during the incubation,
      the cell surface became obviously rough and disrupted. rMjALF-D showed distinct
      binding ability after direct incubation with M. luteus and P. damselae but no
      binding ability to Escherichia coli, which was weakly inhibited by rMjALF-D.
      These data suggest that MjALF-D displays modest antibacterial activity and may
      provide more insights into the function and role of ALF in shrimp immunity.

AB  - A novel molecularly imprinted electrochemiluminescence (MIECL) sensor based on
      the luminescence of molecularly imprinted polymer-perovskite (MIP-CsPbBr3) layer 
      and Ru(bpy)3(2+) was fabricated for simazine detection. MIP-CsPbBr3 layers were
      immobilized onto the surface of glassy carbon electrode as the capture and signal
      amplification probe, and Ru(bpy)3(2+) and co-reactant tripropylamine exhibited
      stronger electrochemiluminescence (ECL) emission. Under optimal conditions, the
      ECL signal of the MIECL sensor was linearly quenched, with the logarithm of
      simazine concentration ranging from 0.1 mug/L to 500.0 mug/L, correlation
      coefficient of 0.9947, and limit of detection of 0.06 mug/L. The practicality of 
      the developed MIECL sensor method for simazine determination in aquatic samples
      was validated. Excellent recoveries of 86.5 %-103.9 % with relative standard
      deviation below 1.6 % were obtained for fish and shrimp samples at three
      different spiked concentrations. The MIECL sensor exhibited excellent
      selectivity, sensitivity, reproducibility, accuracy, and precision for simazine
      determination in actual aquatic samples.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) pollution caused by marine oil spills and
      antibiotic pollution caused by aquaculture industries were common environmental
      problems in the Yellow River Estuary, China. But few data are reported on the
      bioaccumulation and influencing factors of these two types of contaminants in
      aquaculture simultaneously. This study investigated the occurrence and
      bioaccumulation of PAHs and antibiotics in aquaculture areas of the Yellow River 
      Estuary, and explored the factors affecting the bioaccumulation. 3-ring PAHs and 
      fluoroquinolones were dominant contaminants in the study area. The concentrations
      of PAHs and antibiotics in lipid-rich tissues (fish viscus, shrimp head, and crab
      ovary) was higher than that in muscle. It indicated that the lipid content was an
      important factor affecting the bioaccumulation capacity. Physicochemical
      parameters (Kow and Dlipw) and the concentrations of PAHs or antibiotics also
      affected the bioaccumulation capacity of them. Meanwhile, biotransformation was a
      factor affecting the bioaccumulation of PAHs and antibiotics. The
      biotransformation (pyrene to 1-hydroxypyrene and enrofloxacin to ciprofloxacin)
      might explain the poor correlation between log bioaccumulation factor and log
      Kow/log Dlipw in fish. Risk assessment indicated that PAHs in mature aquatic
      products posed carcinogenic risks to human and enoxacin in sea cucumbers posed
      health risks to human.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are attracting increasing concern worldwide.
      Many previous studies have investigated the occurrence and concentrations of ARGs
      in aquaculture. However, the sources of ARGs and the links with their potential
      bacterial hosts have not yet been explored. This study investigated the
      abundances and diversity of ARGs in two types of shrimp farms in South China
      through metagenomic sequencing. In total, 14 ARG types were detected.
      Tetracycline was the dominant ARG type. The abundances of ARGs in samples
      decreased in the order of duck feces > water source > sediment > shrimp gut >
      pond water. The samples from the duck-shrimp integrated farm contained
      1.29-3.81-fold more abundant ARGs than those from the shrimp monoculture farm (p 
      < 0.05). Several ARGs, that were most predominant in the duck feces samples, were
      also the most predominant in the shrimp gut samples from the duck-shrimp
      integrated farm. Redundancy analysis indicated that the abundances and
      distribution of ARGs formed three clusters: duck feces, water samples, and
      sediment and shrimp gut samples. The dominant genera in duck feces known as human
      pathogenic bacteria were potential hosts of ARGs, and were also dominant in the
      shrimp gut samples in the duck-shrimp integrated farm. Additionally, the
      abundances of dominant genera in the shrimp gut samples of the duck-shrimp
      integrated farm were 1.74-35.07-fold higher than those in the shrimp monoculture 
      farm (p < 0.01). The duck-shrimp integrated farm had 3.36-fold and 4.94-fold
      higher abundances of ARGs and mobile genetic elements in the shrimp gut samples
      than those from the shrimp monoculture farm, respectively (p < 0.05). The results
      indicate that duck feces may be a crucial source of diverse and abundant ARGs
      spreading to reared shrimps in duck-shrimp integrated farms, posing a severe risk
      to public health.

TI  - Psychobiotic Potential of Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid-Producing Marine Enterococcus
      faecium SH9 from Marine Shrimp.
LID - 10.1007/s12602-022-09963-z [doi]
AB  - Psychobiotics are a novel class of probiotics with potential to confer mental
      wellness via production of neuroactive compounds such as gamma-aminobutyric acid 
      (GABA). The demand for new biological sources of GABA has increased steadily.
      Therefore, the current study reports the isolation of 17 presumptive lactic acid 
      bacteria (LAB) from marine samples and their screening for GABA synthesis from
      monosodium glutamate (MSG) using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The isolate SH9
      was selected as a high GABA producing strain. The GABA content of SH9 cell free
      supernatant (CFS) was quantitatively determined by high performance liquid
      chromatography (HPLC) to be 0.97 g/L. SH9 was identified biochemically and
      molecularly as Enterococcus faecium (identity 99%). Moreover, SH9 demonstrated
      promising probiotic potentials; it gave no signs of hemolysis and could survive
      at low pH values and high bile salt concentrations. It also exhibited
      antimicrobial activity against highly pathogenic strains and the ability to grow 
      at 6.5% NaCl. In addition, SH9 CFS showed anti-inflammatory and antioxidant
      properties. The glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) gene was detected in SH9 by using
      specific primers. Product of 540 bp was obtained, sequenced, and analyzed
      (accession number: MW713382). The inferred amino acid sequence was 99.3%
      identical to Lactobacillus plantarum M-6 gadB gene. The findings of this study
      suggest that the marine isolate E. faecium SH9 could be used as a novel
      psychobiotics in the development of GABA rich healthy products.

AB  - This study evaluated the bioconcentration metrics, organ-specific distribution,
      and trophic consequences of silver nanoparticles along a Dunaliella
      salina-Artemia salina-Poecilia reticulata food chain. To this end, accumulation, 
      tissue-specific distribution, bioconcentration and biomagnification factors, and 
      trophic toxicity of AgNPs were quantitatively investigated along di- and
      tri-trophic food chains. Overall, silver accumulation increased markedly in
      intestine and liver tissues, carcass, and embryos of guppy fish with rising
      exposure concentrations and reducing trophic levels. Following trophic and
      waterborne exposure, AgNPs illustrated a regular tendency in following order:
      intestine > liver > embryos > carcass. BCF displayed values of 826, 131, and
      approximately 1000 for microalgae, brine shrimp, and guppy fish, respectively.
      Moreover, BMF showed values <1.00 for 48-h post-hatched nauplii and guppy fish
      received AgNPs-exposed phytoplankton, yet >1.00 for the liver and whole body of
      guppy fish treated with AgNPs-exposed nauplii through algae and water, indicating
      that AgNPs could be biomagnified from the second to third trophic level, but not 
      from the first to second or third levels. Furthermore, the waterborne and trophic
      exposure of AgNPs considerably induced oxidative stress and reproductive
      toxicity. Together, this study demonstrated that AgNPs could be biomagnified
      across trophic chain and consequently cause trophic toxicity.

AB  - In this paper, a portable fluorescence-based functional hydrogel loaded with
      beta-d-glucose pentaacetate (beta-D-GP) is designed for high-sensitive
      quantification of amine vapor and visual monitoring of freshness of shrimp. We
      found for the first time that amine vapor can mediate beta-D-GP to generate
      photoluminescent polymer-carbon nanodots (PCNDs) with good optical properties. On
      this basis, a functional hydrogel sensing platform is simply formed by
      solidifying beta-D-GP in agarose hydrogels. When exposure to the volatile amines 
      released from the spoilage of shrimp, beta-D-GP in hydrogel is immediately
      mediated by amines to generate PCNDs, resulting in obvious fluorescence-based
      color variation of functional hydrogel. Notably, a smartphone is used to obtain
      digital photographs and RGB (Red/Green/Blue) information of hydrogels for on-site
      quantitative analysis. The gray value of G/(R + B) of hydrogel shows good
      linearity with trimethylamine (TMA) vapor concentration in the range of 0-59.49 x
      10(-9) mol dm(-3). More importantly, the G/(R + B) value of functional hydrogel
      is successfully used to assess the freshness of shrimp. Consequently, this
      strategy provides a low-cost, portable fluorescence analysis device with
      promising applications in achieving high-sensitive, nondestructive, and on-site
      food safety evaluation of animal-derived aquatic products.

AB  - Aquaculture generates significant amount of processing wastes (more than 500
      million pounds annually in the United States), the bulk of which ends up in the
      environment or is used in animal feed. Proper utilization of shrimp waste can
      increase their economic value and divert them from landfills. In this study,
      shrimp waste was converted to a porous carbon (named SPC) via direct pyrolysis
      and activation. SPC was characterized, and its performance for adsorbing
      ciprofloxacin from simulated water, natural waters, and wastewater was
      benchmarked against a commercial powdered activated carbon (PAC). The surface
      area of SPC (2262m(2)/g) exceeded that of PAC (984m(2)/g) due to abundance of
      micropores and mesopores. The adsorption of ciprofloxacin by SPC was
      thermodynamically spontaneous (DeltaG = -19kJ/mol) and fast (k1 = 1.05/min) at 25
      degrees C. The capacity of SPC for ciprofloxacin (442mg/g) was higher than that
      of PAC (181mg/g). SPC also efficiently and simultaneously removed low
      concentrations (200microg/L) of ciprofloxacin, long-chain per- and
      polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and Cu ions from water. An artificial neural
      network function was derived to predict ciprofloxacin adsorption and identify the
      relative contribution of each input parameter. This study demonstrates a
      sustainable and commercially viable pathway to reuse shrimp processing wastes.

TI  - Seafood Paramyosins as Sources of Anti-Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme and
      Anti-Dipeptidyl-Peptidase Peptides after Gastrointestinal Digestion: A
      Cheminformatic Investigation.
LID - 3864 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27123864 [doi]
AB  - Paramyosins, muscle proteins occurring exclusively in invertebrates, are abundant
      in seafoods. The potential of seafood paramyosins (SP) as sources of
      anti-angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) and anti-dipeptidyl-peptidase (DPP-IV)
      peptides is underexplored. This in silico study investigated the release of
      anti-ACE and anti-DPP-IV peptides from SP after gastrointestinal (GI) digestion. 
      We focused on SP of the common octopus, Humboldt squid, Japanese abalone,
      Japanese scallop, Mediterranean mussel, Pacific oyster, sea cucumber, and
      Whiteleg shrimp. SP protein sequences were digested on BIOPEP-UWM, followed by
      identification of known anti-ACE and anti-DPP-IV peptides liberated. Upon
      screening for high-GI-absorption, non-allergenicity, and non-toxicity,
      shortlisted peptides were analyzed via molecular docking and dynamic to elucidate
      mechanisms of interactions with ACE and DPP-IV. Potential novel anti-ACE and
      anti-DPP-IV peptides were predicted by SwissTargetPrediction. Physicochemical and
      pharmacokinetics of peptides were predicted with SwissADME. GI digestion
      liberated 2853 fragments from SP. This comprised 26 known anti-ACE and 53
      anti-DPP-IV peptides exhibiting high-GI-absorption, non-allergenicity, and
      non-toxicity. SwissTargetPrediction predicted three putative anti-ACE (GIL, DL,
      AK) and one putative anti-DPP-IV (IAL) peptides. Molecular docking found most of 
      the anti-ACE peptides may be non-competitive inhibitors, whereas all anti-DPP-IV 
      peptides likely competitive inhibitors. Twenty-five nanoseconds molecular
      dynamics simulation suggests the stability of these screened peptides, including 
      the three predicted anti-ACE and one predicted anti-DPP-IV peptides. Seven
      dipeptides resembling approved oral-bioavailable peptide drugs in physicochemical
      and pharmacokinetic properties were revealed: AY, CF, EF, TF, TY, VF, and VY. In 
      conclusion, our study presented in silico evidence for SP being a promising
      source of bioavailable and safe anti-ACE and anti-DPP-IV peptides following GI
      digestions.

TI  - Fatty Acid Profile and Antioxidant Capacity of Dabai (Canarium odontophyllum L.):
      Effect of Origin and Fruit Component.
LID - 3840 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27123840 [doi]
AB  - In the present work, the influence of geographical location on the fatty acid
      profiles, antioxidant potential, as well as cytotoxicity of edible dabai fruit
      fractions (kernel, skin, and pulp) were analyzed. The fatty acid profiles were
      determined by Gas Chromatography (GC), and the antioxidant activity was
      quantified with free 2,2-diphenyl-1-picr/ylhdrazyl, while the cytotoxicity was
      assessed by the brine shrimp lethality test. The results showed that the samples 
      from Sibu, Serian, and Kapit geographical locations had a high content of the
      saturated fatty acids, ranging from 46.63% to 53.31% in the three fractions. The 
      highest mono-saturated fatty acids (MUFA) content was found in Sibu. Serian and
      Kapit kernel fractions MUFA, however, ranged from 21.2% to 45.91%. No fatty acid 
      composition was detected in Bentong and Kanowit. The fatty acid composition and
      DPPH free radical scavenging antioxidant activity of dabai were statistically
      independent using a multivariate analysis in different localities in Malaysia.
      The skin fraction had a more appreciable antioxidant potential and toxicity level
      than the pulp and kernel fractions. The highest antioxidant activity (EC50 198.76
      +/- 1.06 microg/mL) with an LC50 value of 1387.22 microg/mL was obtained from the
      Sibu skin fraction. Therefore, the fatty acid composition, antioxidant, as well
      as cytotoxicity analyses of the extracts from different localities indicated that
      "geographical location" remarkably influenced fatty acid composition, antioxidant
      activity, and toxicity.

TI  - Investigation of the New Inhibitors by Sulfadiazine and Modified Derivatives of
      alpha-D-glucopyranoside for White Spot Syndrome Virus Disease of Shrimp by In
      Silico: Quantum Calculations, Molecular Docking, ADMET and Molecular Dynamics
      Study.
LID - 3694 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27123694 [doi]
AB  - The alpha-D-glucopyranoside and its derivatives were as the cardinal
      investigation for developing an effective medication to treat the highest deadly 
      white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) diseases in Shrimp. In our forthcoming work,
      both computational tools, such as molecular docking, quantum calculations,
      pharmaceutical kinetics, ADMET, and their molecular dynamics, as well as the
      experimental trial against WSSV, were executed to develop novel inhibitors. In
      the beginning, molecular docking was carried out to determine inhibitors of the
      four targeted proteins of WSSV (PDB ID: 2ED6, 2GJ2, 2GJI, and 2EDM), and to
      determine the binding energies and interactions of ligands and proteins after
      docking. The range of binding affinity was found to be between -5.40 and -7.00
      kcal/mol for the protein 2DEM, from -5.10 to 6.90 kcal/mol for the protein 2GJ2, 
      from -4.70 to -6.2 kcal/mol against 2GJI, and from -5.5 kcal/mol to -6.6 kcal/mol
      for the evolved protein 2ED6 whereas the L01 and L03 display the highest binding 
      energy in the protein 2EDM. After that, the top-ranked compounds (L01, L02, L03, 
      L04, and L05), based on their high binding energies, were tested for molecular
      dynamics (MD) simulations of 100 ns to verify the docking validation and
      stability of the docked complex by calculating the root mean square deviation
      (RMSD) and root mean square fluctuation (RMSF). The molecules with the highest
      binding energy were then picked and compared to the standard drugs that were been
      applied to fish experimentally to evaluate the treatment at various doses.
      Consequently, approximately 40-45% cure rate was obtained by applying the dose of
      oxytetracycline (OTC) 50% with vitamin C with the 10.0 g/kg feed for 10 days.
      These drugs (L09 to L12) have also been executed for molecular docking to compare
      with alpha-D-glucopyranoside and its derivatives (L01 to L08). Next, the
      evaluation of pharmacokinetic parameters, such as drug-likeness and Lipinski's
      principles; absorption; distribution; metabolism; excretion; and toxicity (ADMET)
      factors, were employed gradually to further evaluate their suitability as
      inhibitors. It was discovered that all ligands (L01 to L12) were devoid of
      hepatotoxicity, and the AMES toxicity excluded L05. Additionally, all of the
      compounds convey a significant aqueous solubility and cannot permeate the
      blood-brain barrier. Moreover, quantum calculations based on density functional
      theory (DFT) provide the most solid evidence and testimony regarding their
      chemical stability, chemical reactivity, biological relevance, reactive nature

TI  - High Throughput Screening of Antimicrobial Resistance Genes in Gram-Negative
      Seafood Bacteria.
LID - 1225 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10061225 [doi]
AB  - From a global view of antimicrobial resistance over different sectors, seafood
      and the marine environment are often considered as potential reservoirs of
      antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs);
      however, there are few studies and sparse results on this sector. This study aims
      to provide new data and insights regarding the content of resistance markers in
      various seafood samples and sources, and therefore the potential exposure to
      humans in a global One Health approach. An innovative high throughput qPCR
      screening was developed and validated in order to simultaneously investigate the 
      presence of 41 ARGs and 33 MGEs including plasmid replicons, integrons, and
      insertion sequences in Gram-negative bacteria. Analysis of 268 seafood isolates
      from the bacterial microflora of cod (n = 24), shellfish (n = 66), flat fishes (n
      = 53), shrimp (n = 10), and horse mackerel (n = 115) show the occurrence of
      sul-1, ant(3'')-Ia, aph(3')-Ia, strA, strB, dfrA1, qnrA, and blaCTX-M-9 genes in 
      Pseudomonas spp., Providencia spp., Klebsiella spp., Proteus spp., and Shewanella
      spp. isolates and the presence of MGEs in all bacterial species investigated. We 
      found that the occurrence of MGE may be associated with the seafood type and the 
      environmental, farming, and harvest conditions. Moreover, even if MGE were
      detected in half of the seafood isolates investigated, association with ARG was
      only identified for twelve isolates. The results corroborate the hypothesis that 
      the incidence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (ARB) and ARG decreases with
      increasing distance from potential sources of fecal contamination. This unique
      and original high throughput micro-array designed for the screening of ARG and
      MGE in Gram-negative bacteria could be easily implementable for monitoring
      antimicrobial resistance gene markers in diverse contexts.

TI  - Evaluation of Salipiger thiooxidans and Exiguobacterium aestuarii from the

LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10061113 [doi]
AB  - In this study, two bacterial species, Salipiger thiooxidans and Exiguobacterium
      aestuarii, were extracted and screened from the Saemangeum Reservoir. This study 
      examined these species' suitability as a probiotic by confirming the effects of
      S. thiooxidans and E. aestuarii added to rearing water for L. vannamei. Three
      experimental groups were evaluated for 6 weeks: (1) a control group reared in
      natural (i.e., untreated) water (CON), (2) an experimental group in which S.
      thiooxidans was added to natural water (SMG-A), and (3) natural water inoculated 
      with E. aestuarii (SMG-B). The SMG-B group inoculated with E. aestuarii showed
      significantly higher final body weight, weight gain, specific growth rates, and
      feed efficiency than the control group. The SMG-B group inoculated with E.
      aestuarii exhibited significantly higher levels of serum lysozyme, and ACP and
      ALP activity than the control and SMG-A groups. The SMG-A and SMG-B groups
      inoculated with probiotics showed significantly lower total ammonia nitrogen and 
      nitrite than the control group. Our findings suggest that S. thiooxidans and E.
      aestuarii extracted from the Saemangeum Reservoir can improve the water quality
      of aquaculture water, and, in particular, E. aestuarii is a potential probiotic
      for L. vannamei.

TI  - The Optimization of Dietary Protein Level and Carbon Sources on Biofloc Nutritive
      Values, Bacterial Abundance, and Growth Performances of Whiteleg Shrimp
      (Litopenaeusvannamei) Juveniles.
LID - 888 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/life12060888 [doi]
AB  - A biofloc technology-based 75-day indoor growth trial in an 80 L glass aquaria
      was conducted to evaluate the effects of two different carbon sources (sugarcane 
      bagasse, SB, and wheat flour, WF) on the biofloc composition, bacterial
      abundance, and growth of whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) juveniles (0.23
      +/- 0.04 g). Three different levels of dietary protein content (250, 300, and 350
      g protein kg(-1) diet) and two carbon sources (SB and WF) were applied (SB250,
      WF250, SB300, WF300, SB350, and WF350, respectively), comparing to a controlled
      diet without biofloc and fed on a 450 g protein kg(-1) diet (C450). With the
      addition of SB and WF, water quality was in the ideal recommended ranges for L.
      vannamei culture. At the end of the experiment, the biofloc volume increased with
      increasing dietary protein levels. The nutritional value of biofloc in different 
      treatments was influenced by dietary protein and added SB and WF. Increasing
      dietary protein significantly increased the protein and lipid contents of the
      produced biofloc. The use of WF as a carbon source significantly increased lipids
      and nitrogen-free extract in the biofloc. The total heterotrophic bacterial (THB)
      count was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) in WF300 and WF350 than in the other
      treatments. The mean effect of the protein levels and carbon source was
      significantly reported, whereas the highest significant THB count was recorded
      with 300 dietary protein and using WF as a carbon source. The growth performances
      of L. vannamei fed with biofloc treatments were significantly (p &lt; 0.05)
      higher than the C450 group. The highest final weight and weight gain were
      recorded in SB350 treatment. The feed conversion ratio was not affected by
      reducing dietary protein levels; meanwhile, the protein efficiency ratio
      increased significantly in biofloc treatments than in the control. Overall, the
      results demonstrate that, compared to the control treatment of 450 dietary
      protein, the biofloc treatments using WF as a carbon source could compensate for 
      the reduction in the dietary protein levels in the diet of L. vannamei and
      maintain higher zootechnical performance.

TI  - A Type Ib Crustin from Deep-Sea Shrimp Possesses Antimicrobial and
      Immunomodulatory Activity.
LID - 6444 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23126444 [doi]
AB  - Crustins are small antimicrobial proteins produced by crustaceans. Of the many
      reported crustins, very few are from deep sea environments. Crustins are
      categorized into several types. Recently, the Type I crustin has been further
      classified into three subtypes, one of which is Type Ib, whose function is
      unknown. Here, we studied the function of a Type Ib crustin (designated Crus2)
      identified from a deep-sea crustacean. Crus2 has a whey acidic protein (WAP)
      domain and a long C-terminal region (named P58). Recombinant Crus2 bound to
      peptidoglycan (PGN), lipoteichoic acid (LTA), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and
      killed Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by permeabilizing the bacterial
      cytomembrane. Consistently, Crus2 dramatically attenuated the inflammatory
      response induced by LPS and LTA. Disruption of the disulfide bonds in the WAP
      domain abolished the bactericidal ability of Crus2, but had no effect on the
      bacterial binding ability of Crus2. Deletion of the C-terminal P58 region
      moderately affected the antimicrobial activity of Crus2 against some bacteria.
      P58 as a synthesized peptide could bind bacteria and inhibit the bactericidal
      activity of Crus2. Taken together, these results revealed different roles played 
      by the WAP domain and the P58 region in Type Ib crustin, and provided new
      insights into the antimicrobial and immunomodulatory functions of crustins.

TI  - Whole-Genome Identification and Analysis of Multiple Gene Families Reveal
      Candidate Genes for Theasaponin Biosynthesis in Camellia oleifera.
LID - 6393 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23126393 [doi]
AB  - Camellia oleifera is an economically important oilseed tree. Seed meals of C.
      oleifera have a long history of use as biocontrol agents in shrimp farming and as
      cleaning agents in peoples' daily lives due to the presence of theasaponins, the 
      triterpene saponins from the genus Camellia. To characterize the biosynthetic
      pathway of theasaponins in C. oleifera, members of gene families involved in
      triterpenoid biosynthetic pathways were identified and subjected to phylogenetic 
      analysis with corresponding members in Arabidopsis thaliana, Camellia sinensis,
      Actinidia chinensis, Panax ginseng, and Medicago truncatula. In total, 143
      triterpenoid backbone biosynthetic genes, 1169 CYP450s, and 1019 UGTs were
      identified in C. oleifera. The expression profiles of triterpenoid backbone
      biosynthetic genes were analyzed in different tissue and seed developmental
      stages of C. oleifera. The results suggested that MVA is the main pathway for
      triterpenoid backbone biosynthesis. Moreover, the candidate genes for theasaponin
      biosynthesis were identified by WGCNA and qRT-PCR analysis; these included 11
      CYP450s, 14 UGTs, and eight transcription factors. Our results provide valuable
      information for further research investigating the biosynthetic and regulatory
      network of theasaponins.

TI  - CE-RAA-CRISPR Assay: A Rapid and Sensitive Method for Detecting Vibrio
      parahaemolyticus in Seafood.
LID - 1681 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/foods11121681 [doi]
AB  - Vibrio parahaemolyticus is one of the major pathogenic Vibrio species that
      contaminate seafood. Rapid and accurate detection is crucial for avoiding
      foodborne diseases caused by pathogens and is important for food safety
      management and mariculture. In this study, we established a system that combines 
      chemically enhanced clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
      (CRISPR) and recombinase-aided amplification (RAA) (CE-RAA-CRISPR) for detecting 
      V. parahaemolyticus in seafood. The method combines RAA with CRISPR-associated
      protein 12a (Cas12a) for rapid detection in a one-pot reaction, effectively
      reducing the risk of aerosol contamination during DNA amplifier transfer. We
      optimized the primers for V. parahaemolyticus, determined the optimal
      crRNA/Cas12a ratio, and demonstrated that chemical additives (bovine serum
      albumin and L-proline) could enhance the detection capacity of Cas12a. The limit 
      of detection (at optimal conditions) was as low as 6.7 x 10(1) CFU/mL in pure
      cultures and 7.3 x 10(1) CFU/g in shrimp. Moreover, this method exhibited no
      cross-reactivity with other microbial pathogens. The CE-RAA-CRISPR assay was
      compared with the quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay using actual food 
      samples, and it showed 100% diagnostic agreement.

TI  - Growth, Health, and Gut Microbiota of Female Pacific White Shrimp, Litopenaeus
      vannamei Broodstock Fed Different Phospholipid Sources.
LID - 1143 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antiox11061143 [doi]
AB  - Phospholipids have an important antioxidant effect on animals. The effects of
      different dietary phospholipid sources on the growth, antioxidant activity,
      immunity, and gut microbiota of female broodstock of Pacific white shrimp
      Litopenaeus vannamei were investigated. Four isoproteic and isolipid
      semi-purified diets containing 4% soybean lecithin (SL), egg yolk lecithin (EL), 
      or krill oil (KO) and a control diet without phospholipid supplementation were
      fed to female broodstock of L. vannamei (34.7 +/- 4.2 g) for 28 days. The growth 
      performance, antioxidative capacity, and innate immunity of the female broodstock
      fed phospholipid supplemented diets were improved regardless of sources compared 
      with the control shrimp. The effects on growth and antioxidant capacity in female
      shrimp fed the KO diet were highest. The innate immunity of female shrimp fed the
      EL and KO diets were significantly higher than shrimp fed the SL diet. Dietary
      phospholipid supplementation increased gut microbiota diversity and richness, and
      the Chao1 and ACE values in the KO group were significantly higher than in the
      control group. The richness of Proteobacteria, Photobacterium, and Vibrio
      decreased, whereas the richness of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes increased in the 
      shrimp fed the KO diet compared with the shrimp fed the SL and EL diets. The
      interactions of gut microbiota in shrimp fed the KO diet were the most complex,
      and the positive interaction was the largest among all the treatments. The
      functional genes of gut microbiota in shrimp fed the KO diet were significantly
      enriched in lipid metabolism and terpenoid/polyketide metabolism pathways.
      Spearman correlation analysis showed that Fusibacter had significantly positive
      correlations with antioxidant activity (total antioxidant capacity, superoxide
      dismutase, glutathione peroxidase), immune enzyme activity (phenoloxidase and
      lysozyme), and immune gene expression (C-type lectin 3, Caspase-1). All findings 
      suggest that dietary phospholipids supplementation can improve the growth and
      health status of female L. vananmei broodstock. Krill oil is more beneficial in
      improving the antioxidant capacity and innate immunity than other dietary
      phospholipid sources. Furthermore, krill oil can help establish the intestinal
      immune barrier by increasing the richness of Fusibacter and promote the growth of
      female shrimp. Fusibacter may be involved in iron metabolism to improve the
      antioxidant capacity of female shrimp.

LID - 10.3390/ani12121527 [doi]
AB  - This study aims to evaluate a Pacific white shrimp and Nile tilapia integrated
      system using biofloc technology with or without the addition of the microalgae
      Scenedesmus obliquus and with or without fish feed supplementation in a
      two-factor 62-day experiment. The shrimp (2.16 +/- 0.01 g) were reared under a
      density of 400 shrimp m(-3) and the fish (1.53 +/- 0.12 g) were reared under a
      density of 522 fish m(-3). The microalgae was added to the culture water two
      times a week. Growth performance, sludge production, and water microbiology were 
      evaluated. Fish feed and the microalgae addition improved fish final biomass in
      58% and 14%, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). Fish survival was significantly higher
      when microalgae was added (93.9 +/- 1.8%) compared with the treatments without
      microalgae addition (86.2 +/- 7.6%) (p &lt; 0.05). The yield of the overall
      system was higher in the treatments with fish feed supplementation (4.2 +/- 0.2
      kg m(-3)) compared with no addition (3.9 +/- 0.2 kg m(-3)) (p &lt; 0.05). These
      results suggest that fish feed supplementation at the rate of 1% of the biomass
      and microalgae inoculation can improve fish growth performance and system yield, 
      without affecting sludge production and water microbiology. This work is an
      expansion of a conference paper with the same title.

AB  - Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a family of emerging
      contaminants which are widely present in environment. In this work, novel
      UiO-66-F4/polyacrylonitrile (UiO-66-F4/PAN) hybrid nanofibers were firstly
      prepared via blend electrospinning or in-situ growth method for the pipette-tip
      solid phase extraction of PFASs. Characterizations demonstrate the as-synthesized
      UiO-66-F4/PAN nanofibers have good chemical and thermal stability, possess large 
      surface area (248 m(2)/g) and mesoporous framework structure. Several extraction 
      factors including the amount of adsorbent, pH and ionic strength of sample
      solution, extraction time and eluent were investigated and the optimum conditions
      are 20 mg of the selected sorbent, adjusting to pH 5 and adding 4% w/v NaCl to
      sample solution, extraction for 12 min (3 min x 4). The good adsorption affinity 
      of UiO-66-F4/PAN for PFASs can be attributed to the extensive adsorption sites
      and multiple interactions including hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bonding and
      F-F interaction. Low limit of detection (0.008-0.076 microg/L), limit of
      quantification (0.010-0.163 microg/L) and recoveries (70.84-113.57%) for 9 PFASs 
      with relative standard deviations < 15% were achieved. When applied in the

AB  - The United Nations Decade on Ecosystem restoration (2021 not-2030) lists mangrove
      ecosystems as a restoration priority. Interest in their conservation has
      increased recently due to their widespread degradation. Anthropogenic stressors
      and rehabilitation practices, specifically, have resulted in a significant
      decline in their species compositions. We investigated the knowledge gaps in
      terms of potential spatial diversity, intertidal zonation, and the historic state
      of mangrove forest species, and tested the role of environmental factors such as 
      topography, as well as rehabilitation practices on diversity. Diversity and
      complexity indices, surface elevation, and species and structural diversities
      along three simplified transect lines over a broad geographical area and under
      various management practices were analyzed in Trat province, Thailand.
      Quantitative statistical zonation analyses within each transect and at the
      landscape-scale were performed using randomization tests and hierarchical cluster
      analysis. A modified "automatic regrowth monitoring algorithm (ARMA)," based on
      Landsat (1987-2020) and Sentinel-2 MSI (2015-2020) annual median composites was
      also used. Fifteen species were identified, with Ceriops tagal as the dominant
      species. Statistical analysis, however, failed to identify any significant
      zonation patterns at transect or landscape-scales at specific elevations.
      Rehabilitated and naturally regenerated stands showed gradual increases in their 
      Normalized Difference Infrared Index over time. After 30 years, the rehabilitated
      stands made up of Rhizophoraceae monocultures were the same height as the
      adjacent natural stands. Depending on the location and propagule availability,
      the diversity and structure of regenerated stands exhibited high variation.
      Effluent from shrimp farms may have contributed to the disturbance of the forest 
      stands and changes in shrimp farming practices could have facilitated their
      recovery. The results of the present study provide a valuable diversity baseline 
      for the study site and secondary succession in rehabilitated and regenerated
      mangroves. The ARMA algorithm has also been confirmed as a valuable tool for
      future investigations of secondary succession and mangrove biodiversity status.

AB  - Diseases outbreaks in pond aquaculture have resulted in huge losses to the
      aquaculture industry. The emergence of non-antimicrobial and environment friendly
      agents (probiotics) is the potential consideration for the healthy shrimp
      aquaculture. The present study was aimed to compare the bacterial community
      compositions in shrimp ponds and surrounding seawater, as well as isolate
      probiotic bacteria from the shrimp ponds. Based on the high-throughput of 16S
      rRNA gene sequencing, all sequences were assigned to 3584 unique operational
      taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% similarity levels, which were affiliated with 24
      phyla, 54 classes, 235 families, and 367 genera. The 10 most abundant phyla were 
      Bacteroidota, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteriota, Planctomycetota, Cyanobacteria,
      Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Desulfobacterota, Patescibacteria and Verrucomicrobiota.
      Notably, the alpha diversity (Shannon diversity) of shrimp ponds was
      significantly differences (P < 0.05) with that of surrounding seawater. There
      were 2498 and 791 unique OTUs in shrimp ponds and surrounding seawater,
      respectively. A total of 15 isolates were obtained in the culturable bacterial
      diversity, and the antibacterial activities were recorded for potential probiotic
      bacterial isolates against different tested bacterial isolates including
      pathogenic bacteria. An isolate Hallobacillus marinus HMALI004 showed strong
      inhibitory effects against three pathogenic bacteria, Vibrio cholerae CECT 514,
      non AHPND V. parahaemolyticus BCRC12959 and AHPND V. parahaemolyticus PD-2. The
      isolates Algophigus sanaruensis AGALI005, Algoriphagus taiwanensis ATALI009 and
      Bacillus aequororis BAALI008 were also identified as potential probiotics
      strains.

      shrimp in Indian marine crabs.
PG  - 416
LID - 10.1007/s00203-022-03025-2 [doi]
AB  - Enterocytozoon hepatopanaei parasite (EHP) is identified as an emerging
      pathogenic microsporidium parasite in shrimp culture industry. Though the
      etiology, disease pattern and sustainability of shrimp are well known,
      significantly less research has been carried out about the disease transmission
      and symptoms of infected aquatic animals. The present study aims is to determine 
      the disease carrier status of five different species of Indian marine crabs
      (Scylla olivacea, Scylla serrata, Portunus pelagicus, Ocypode quadrata and
      Portunus sanquinolentus) using EHP. At the first instance, oral infection and
      intramuscular injection were performed to determine the susceptibility of the
      parasite at 50 days post-infection and it was observed that there was no
      mortality. The experimental infected crabs were confirmed by polymerase chain
      reaction, bioassay and histopathology. The crabs were EHP-PCR positive at 5th day
      post-infection (d.p.i) in gills, heart, hepatopancreas, haemolymph and muscle
      tissue. However, after 5th d.p.i EHP was PCR negative in all the tissue samples. 
      There were no mortalities and histological changes in the negative group and
      experimental group. Therefore, marine crabs are found to be not suitable hosts
      for replicating EHP spores but crabs fecal matters are PCR positive till 5th
      d.p.i. Therefore, marine crabs are having the possibilities of acceptance as a
      vector for Enterocytozoon hepatopanaei in shrimp. Shrimp farmers need to take
      necessary action to control this deadly infection in shrimp ponds.

TI  - Expression of Abdominal-B in the brine shrimp, Artemia franciscana, expands our
      evolutionary understanding of the crustacean abdomen.

AB  - The brine shrimp, Artemia franciscana, has a body plan composed of 11 thoracic
      segments, followed by 2 genital segments, and then 6 additional abdominal
      segments. Previous studies of Artemia reported that expression of the
      posterior-most Hox gene, Abdominal-B (Abd-B), is restricted to the genital
      segments and is not observed posteriorly in the abdomen at any developmental
      stage. This report was remarkable because it suggested that the Artemia abdomen
      posterior to the genital segments was a novel body region of 6 segments that bore
      no homology to any region in other crustaceans and was unique amongst arthropods 
      in being a Hox-free segmented domain outside of the head. In this study, we used 
      RT-PCR, antibody staining, and in situ hybridization on various stages of Artemia
      nauplii to show that Abd-B mRNA and protein are in fact expressed throughout the 
      abdominal segments during Artemia development, but this expression later retracts
      to the two genital segments (G1, G2) and the T11 appendages. This suggests that
      Abd-B does play a role in specifying abdominal segment identity in all
      crustaceans that have been examined and suggests a common evolutionary origin for
      the crustacean abdomen.

AB  - This study analyses the bycatch composition of an artisanal shrimp trawl fleet
      operating between Cabo Blanco and Mancora in Northern Peru between April 2019 and
      March 2020. A total of 300 hauls were analysed with respect to target catch and
      bycatch (consisting of other commercial species, discards, and macroalgae). A
      total of 277 species were recorded including 111 species of fish, 65 species of
      molluscs, 51 species of crustaceans, 22 species of algae, 12 species of
      cnidarian, 9 species of echinoderms, 4 species of Bryozoa and 3 species of
      polychaeta. Capture per unit effort (CPUE, kg.h-1) was highest for fish, followed
      by crustaceans, algae and molluscs. The target species Penaeus californiensis
      coffee shrimp constituted 17.8% of the overall catch,82.2% represented bycatch,
      and 50.6% represented discards. Coffee shrimps were more abundant in June and
      November 2019 and in January and February 2020. Highest bycatch CPUE occurred in 
      May, June and December 2019. The most abundant species in the bycatch throughout 
      the study period were sand perch (Diplectrum conceptione, 16% weight of the total
      catch), the macroalgae caulerpa (Caulerpa filiformis, 13%), sole flounder
      (Etropus ectenes, 6.4%), Pacific drum (Larimus pacificus, 5.7%), and lumptail
      searobin (Prionotus stephanophrys, 5.1%). Overall, the contribution of sand perch
      and flounder, exceeded the weight of coffee shrimp, therefore the interpretation 
      that shrimp is the sole target species needs to be revised. The number of
      discarded species per month increased towards the spring months with the highest 
      value in November. This study represents the first characterisation of bycatch in
      the artisanal trawling fishery in the Piura region in northern Peru and reveals a
      high proportion of bycatch in the fishery but also hints at potential temporal
      management measures that could be imposed to reduce the levels of bycatch. For
      example, the months of May and December had the greatest bycatch to shrimp ratios
      and the fishery could potentially be closed to avoid high bycatch risk, however, 
      longer term information is needed to assess if the trends observed in bycatch are
      similar over longer periods of time. The species characterisation of bycatch also
      provides information for the design of modified nets which would target the
      reduction of small fish present in the catch.

AB  - Vibrio alginolyticus is a globally distributed opportunistic pathogen that causes
      different degrees of disease in various marine organisms, such as fish, shrimp
      and shellfish. At present, vibriosis caused by V. alginolyticus has a wide
      epidemic range and causes frequent outbreaks, resulting in substantial losses in 
      aquaculture. According to previous studies, modified clay (MC) could effectively 
      flocculate and reduce the density of Vibrio in water, but it is still unknown
      whether MC inhibits growth and how it affects virulence in bottom flocs. Here, we
      studied the response mechanism of V. alginolyticus in flocs treated with MC at
      the transcriptome level and verified the transcriptomic data combined with
      relevant physiological experiments and reverse transcription quantitative
      real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) for the first time. It was found that the morphology of
      Vibrio in the MC flocs changed, the membrane function was damaged, the
      antioxidant system was activated, and the material and energy metabolism also
      changed. In addition, MC could inhibit the expression of virulence factors of V. 
      alginolyticus; for example, flagella, pilus, siderophores, quorum sensing, and
      other related genes were significantly downregulated. In general, MC effectively 
      inhibited the growth of Vibrio and reduced its virulence potential in flocs,
      which could provide theoretical support for a new model of healthy aquaculture.

AB  - Marine fish biodiversity and conservation linked to human livelihoods along the
      coast were studied in 2019 using a survey and personal interviews to investigate 
      the effects of environmental and anthropogenic issues on changes in marine fish
      diversity that affect sustainability. The Zoological Survey of India (ZSI)
      authenticated 42 finfish, 6 crabs, and 1 shrimp from three groups collected along
      the coastal zone. The estimated fish species diversity index revealed that alpha 
      and beta biodiversity were more prevalent in the study zone than gamma fish
      diversity. When the collected fish species were compared to the International
      Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) threatened lists, 51% were found to be
      least concerned. The variation in the livelihood status, age group, religious,
      education, houses, training, graft, and gear of fishermen was 93.6% and 4.3%,
      respectively, according to the principle component analysis. The observation of
      51% of the least concerned species in the study zone suggests species declination
      as a result of overexploitation of natural resources. The study suggests that
      strict conservation measures be put in place to ensure the sustainability and
      conservation of fish diversity.

AB  - The objective of this study is to explore the effect and mechanism of ultrasound 
      on chitin extraction from shrimp shells powder (SSP) by the co-fermentation of
      Bacillus subtilis and Acetobacter pasteurianus. After pre-treating the SSP with
      high-intensity ultrasound (HIU) at 800 W, the protease activity in the
      fermentation solution reached 96.9 U/mL on day 3, which was significantly higher 
      than for SSP that had not been pre-treated with ultrasound (81.8 U/mL). The
      fermentation time of the chitin extraction process was 5.0 d without ultrasound
      pre-treatment, while it was shortened to 4.5 d when using ultrasound at 800 W to 
      treat SSP. However, there were no obvious differences when we applied ultrasound 
      at low power (200 W, 400 W). Furthermore, chitin purified from shrimp shells
      pre-treated with HIU at 800 W exhibited lower molecular weight (11.2 kDa), higher
      chitin purity (89.8%), and a higher degree of deacetylation (21.1%) compared to
      SSP with no ultrasound pre-treatment (13.5 kDa, 86.6%, 18.5%). Results indicate
      that HIU peels off the protein/CaCO3 matrix that covers the SSP surface. About
      9.1% of protein and 4.7% of Ca(2+) were released from SSP pre-treated with HIU at
      800 W. These figures were both higher than with no ultrasound pre-treatment
      (4.5%, 3.2%). Additionally, the amount of soluble protein extracted from SSP
      through HIU at 800 W was 50% higher than for the control sample. SDS-PAGE
      analysis indicated that the soluble protein was degraded to the micromolecule. It
      also revealed that HIU (600, 800 W) induced the secondary and tertiary structure 
      destruction of protein extracted from SSP. In conclusion, HIU-induced degradation
      and structural damage of protein enhances the protein/CaCO3 matrix to be peeled
      off from SSP. Also, in the co-fermentation process, an increase of protease
      activity further accelerates deproteinization.

TI  - Application of non-target analysis and high resolution mass spectrometry for the 
      identification of thermal transformation products of oxytetracycline in pacific
      white shrimp.
LID - 10.4315/JFP-22-128 [doi]
AB  - Oxytetracycline is an antibiotic authorized for use in aquaculture and is often
      detected in seafood products, especially shrimp. Previous studies investigating
      the fate of oxytetracycline in shrimp tissues after cooking were limited to
      quantification of parent compound residues, and did not describe any potential
      transformation products formed. Hence, the main objective of this study was to
      apply a non-target analysis workflow to study the fate of oxytetracycline in
      shrimp muscle. Furthermore, "water" and "spiked" models were evaluated if they
      were suitable to track the transformation of OTC in incurred muscle, and
      determine if the matrix plays a role in the transformation pathway. First, four
      different extraction methods were compared for the determination of
      oxytetracycline in muscle. Secondly, raw and cooked samples were then extracted
      using the suitable method (acidified water/methanol/acetonitrile with clean-up of
      samples achieved using freezing) and were analyzed by HPLC-QTOF-MS.
      Oxytetracycline levels were reduced by 75 % and 87% in muscle and water,
      respectively. Identification of thermal transformation products was limited to
      formula generation, but results showed that different compounds were identified
      in spiked and incurred muscle.

AB  - Aims: The present study assessed the toxicity of a novel calcium silicate-based
      root canal sealer (Bio-C Sealer) in comparison to Endosequence BC Sealer and AH
      Plus through a lethality assay involving brine shrimp (Artemia salina). Methods: 
      Brine shrimp cysts were incubated for 24 h for the hatching of the larvae, which 
      were then exposed to different concentrations (2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 100
      mug/mL) of the test endodontic sealers for 24 h, followed by the determination of
      the survival rate. Statistical Analysis Used: One-way repeated-measures ANOVA and
      the Newman-Keuls post hoc test were used to compare the different materials as
      well as different concentrations of the same material. Dunnett's test was used to
      compare the different concentrations and different sealers to the control. The
      lethal concentration of each endodontic sealer necessary to kill 50% of the brine
      shrimp larvae (LC50) was also determined. Results: The toxicity of Bio-C (10, 20,
      40, 80, and 100 mug/mL) and Endosequence BC Sealer (20, 80, and 100 mug/mL) was
      lower than that of AH Plus. No significant difference was found between Bio-C and
      Endosequence BC Sealer or among the different intragroup concentrations of these 
      sealers. In the AH Plus group, concentrations >/=5.0 mug/mL exhibited greater
      toxicity compared to the concentration of 2.5 mug/mL and the control. AH Plus had
      the lowest LC50 (59.95 mug/mL), whereas Bio-C and Endosequence BC Sealer had LC50
      values >200 mug/mL. Conclusions: Bio-C Sealer proved to be less toxic than AH
      Plus and exhibited similar toxicity to that of Endosequence BC Sealer.

AB  - The kelch motif-containing proteins are widely present in organisms and known to 
      be involved in various biological processes, but their roles in immunity remain
      unclear. In this study, a kelch motif-containing protein KLHDC2 was identified
      from Pacific white shrimp Penaeus vannamei and its immune function was
      investigated. The klhdc2 gene was widely expressed in shrimp tissues and its
      protein product was mainly present in the nucleus. Expression of klhdc2 was
      regulated by shrimp NF-kappaB family members Dorsal and Relish, and changed after
      immune stimulation. KLHDC2 could enhance the immune defense against Vibrio
      parahaemolyticus in shrimp but inhibit that against white spot syndrome virus
      (WSSV). Further analyses showed that KLHDC2 did not affect the phagocytosis of
      hemocytes but regulated the expression of a series of immune effector genes.
      KLHDC2 has a complex regulatory relationship with Dorsal and Relish, which may
      partly contribute to its positive role in antibacterial response by regulating
      humoral immunity. Moreover, the regulatory effect of KLHDC2 on WSSV ie1 gene
      contributed to its negative effect on antiviral response. Therefore, the current 
      study enrichs the knowledge on the Kelch family and helps to learn more about the
      regulatory mechanism of shrimp immunity.

AB  - Penaeus vannamei is one of the most popular aquaculture species in the world.
      This species is featured with its fast-growing and delicious taste, which drives 
      people develop various strains. During this process identification of
      trait-associated markers could effectively increase breeding efficiency. Driven
      by this, we tried to screen fast-growing key regulators via a FACS-based high
      throughput method, in which 2-NBDG was applied as a fluorescent indicator for
      direct glucose uptake measurement. Totally six candidate genes were screened out 
      followed by in vitro validation in 293T cells. After that, the correlation
      between these genes and shrimp growing was further verified in a hybrid lineage. 
      The expression level of two genes including ATP synthase subunit e and inhibitor 
      of apoptosis protein showed some correlation with shrimp growth speed.
      Furthermore, we tested these two candidate markers in various lineages and
      confirmed that ATP synthase subunit e could be a shrimp growth-associated
      breeding marker.

AB  - As a naturally occurring amino acid, selenocysteine (Sec) plays a key role in a
      variety of cellular functions and Se-enriched foods. In this work, a robust water
      soluble fluorescence turn-on near-infrared (NIR) sensor NIR-Sec was constructed
      for Sec detection over biothiols in Se-enriched foods. Specifically, NIR-Sec
      contains a readily prepared water soluble NIR dicyanoisophorone fluorophore and a
      well-known response-site 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonyl moiety with strong
      intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect to quench the fluorescence intensity 
      of NIR fluorophore. Upon addition of Sec, the NIR dicyanoisophorone fluorophore
      was released and a bright red emission at 663 nm was observed. Moreover, NIR-Sec 
      toward Sec exhibited rapid response time ( approximately 1 min), a large stoke
      shift (183 nm), and high selectivity and sensitivity (LOD: 52 nM). Impressively, 
      NIR-Sec was successfully employed to detect and image Sec in Se-enriched foods
      and shrimp, indicating NIR-Sec could provide a robust tool for investigating the 
      role of Sec in complex real-food samples.

TI  - Feeding behavior of Gammarus aequicauda in the presence of two prey species of
      Artemia sp. and Baeotendipes noctivagus.
PG  - 768-775
LID - 10.1002/jez.2635 [doi]
AB  - Gammarus aequicauda is the most abundant amphipod species in the Crimean
      hypersaline lakes, and is predatory upon other invertebrate species, suppressing 
      their populations. The authors studied a time balance during the feeding of G.
      aequicauda in the presence of two prey species. The different variants of prey
      composition were: (1) two Artemia sp., (2) two chironomid larvae, and (3) one
      Artemia sp. and one chironomid larva. The duration of the experiments differed
      and continued until both prey were consumed. The experiments were carried out in 
      vessels with and without bottom sediments. The result showed that in vessels with
      and without sediments in the case of both species of prey, the time to the
      capture of the first prey did not depend on whether Artemia sp. or chironomid
      larva was the first prey; the time differences are statistically insignificant.
      The duration of eating prey in all experimental variants depended on the kind of 
      prey, and those differences were highly significant. The average hourly
      consumption rate was dependent on prey composition and order of prey capture and 
      eating. The maximum consumption for two prey was when both were brine shrimp. In 
      vessels without sediments and containing both Artemia sp. and chironomid larva
      the consumption rate was higher if the first caught prey was Artemia sp. rather
      than small es, Cyrillichironomid larva. The order of prey eating did not
      influence a ration size in vessels with bottom sediments. When both prey were
      chironomid larvae, the total diet did not practically differ in vessels with or
      without sediments.

AB  - Viral covert mortality disease (VCMD), also known as running mortality syndrome
      (RMS), is caused by covert mortality nodavirus (CMNV) and has impacted the shrimp
      farming industry in Asia and Latin America in recent years. The pathogenic
      mechanism of CMNV infecting Penaeus vannamei was investigated in this study. In
      the naturally infected shrimp, histopathological and in situ hybridization (ISH) 
      analysis verified that CMNV infection and severe cellar structural damage
      occurred in almost all cells of the ommatidium. Under transmission electron
      microscopic (TEM), vacuolation and necrosis, together with numerous CMNV-like
      particles, could be observed in the cytoplasm of most cell types of the
      ommatidium. The challenge test showed that a low CMNV infectious dose caused
      cumulative mortality of 66.7 +/- 6.7% and 33.3 +/- 3.6% of shrimp in the 31-day
      outdoor and indoor farming trials, respectively. The shrimp in the infection
      group grew slower than those in the control group; the percentage of soft-shell
      individuals in the infection group (42.9%) was much higher than that of the
      control group (17.1%). The histopathological and ISH examinations of individuals 
      artificially infected with CMNV revealed that severe cellar damage, including
      vacuolation, karyopyknosis, and structural failure, occurred not only in the
      cells of the refraction part of the ommatidium, but also in the cells of the
      nerve enrichment and hormone secretion zones. And the pathological damages were
      severe in the nerve cells of both the ventral nerve cord and segmental nerve of
      the pleopods. TEM examination revealed the ultrastructural pathological changes
      and vast amounts of CMNV-like particles in the above-mentioned tissues. The
      differential transcriptome analysis showed that the CMNV infection resulted in
      the significant down-regulated expression of genes of photo-transduction,
      digestion, absorption, and growth hormones, which might be the reason for the
      slow growth of shrimp infected by CMNV. This study uncovered unique
      characteristics of neurotropism of CMNV for the first time and explored the
      pathogenesis of slow growth and shell softening of P. vannamei caused by CMNV
      infection.

TI  - Peroxiredoxin 4 Interacts With Domeless and Participates in Antibacterial Immune 
      Response Through the JAK/STAT Pathway.

AB  - The JAK/STAT pathway plays an important role in the development and immune
      responses of animals. In vertebrates, families of cytokines or growth factors act
      as activators of the JAK/STAT pathway; however, the activators for the JAK/STAT
      signaling pathway in arthropods are largely unknown. Herein we report a new
      ligand, peroxiredoxin 4 (Prx4), for the Domeless in the JAK/STAT pathway of
      shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus. Prx4 was induced to secrete into the extracellular
      surroundings upon Vibrio challenge, which then facilitated the anti-Vibrio
      activity of shrimp by activating the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of
      STAT and the expression of STAT-responsive antimicrobial peptides. Blocking the
      expression of Prx4 in vivo abrogated the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway by
      Vibrio infection, while injection of Prx4 protein activated the pathway. The
      interaction between Prx4 and Domeless was proved by immuno-precipitation and
      protein pull-down assays. Moreover, two cysteine residues in Prx4 that are
      critical for the interaction and Prx4's anti-Vibrio role were identified, and the
      binding site in Domeless for Prx4 was proved to be the cytokine-binding homology 
      module fragment. Taken together, our study revealed a new function for Prx4
      enzyme and established a new enzyme-type ligand for the activation of the
      JAK/STAT pathway in an aquatic arthropod.

AB  - Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a bacterial pathogen in marine aquaculture systems and
      a major cause of food-borne illnesses worldwide. In the present study, Vibrio
      phage KIT05 was isolated from water collected from a shrimp farm in the Mekong
      Delta, Vietnam. It was characterized based on its morphology, growth curve, lytic
      properties, and genome sequence. Under the electron microscope, KIT05 particles
      had an icosahedral head with a diameter of 62.3 nm and a short tail of 24.1 nm.
      The one-step growth curve of KIT05 showed that its latency time was approximately
      40 min and burst size was 18 plaque-forming units/cell. The genome of KIT05
      comprises 50,628 bp with a GC content of 41.63%. It contains 60 open reading
      frames that are encoded within both strands and four tRNAs. The presence of
      direct terminal repeats of 130 bp at both ends of the KIT05 DNA was determined.
      According to phage morphology, genomic organization, and phylogeny analysis,
      Vibrio phage KIT05 was classified into the family Podoviridae. The genome
      annotation revealed that KIT05 had no virulent or lysogenic genes. This study may
      help identify a novel candidate for developing biocontrol agents for Vibrio
      parahaemolyticus.

LID - 10.1111/1750-3841.16226 [doi]
AB  - The effect of bovine serum albumin (BSA) or whey protein isolate (WPI) at various
      concentrations (0.5%, 1.5%, and 3%; w/v) on the properties of shrimp oil-in-water
      emulsion was investigated. Both proteins at 1.5% showed the highest emulsifying
      properties. Moreover, the combined impact of chitosan (CS) at different levels
      (0.25%, 0.50%, 0.75%, and 1%; w/v) and 1.5% BSA or 1.5% WPI on emulsion
      properties was also studied. For the same protein used, those stabilized by BSA
      and WPI in conjunction with CS solution at 0.5% and 0.25% had the highest
      emulsion stability index, respectively. During storage for 28 days, the
      BSA-CSstabilized emulsion had higher turbidity, a*, b* but the lowest L* values
      compared to the WPI-CS counterpart (p < 0.05). Emulsion stabilized by the BSA-CS 
      complex showed higher stability, as witnessed by lower d32 and d43 and lower
      flocculation factor and coalescence index, but it had a lower negative charge
      than those stabilized by the WPI-CS complex (p < 0.05). Oil droplets of the
      BSA-CS-stabilized emulsion showed a lower extent of size enlargement after
      storage. Rheological studies revealed viscous, shear-thinning, and non-Newtonian 
      behavior of emulsions. Overall, emulsion stabilized by the BSA-CS complex had
      higher stability than that stabilized by the WPI-CS complex, and the former could
      maintain the stability of pigment in shrimp oil to some extent. PRACTICAL
      APPLICATION: Oil from shrimp hepatopancreas is a rich source of both astaxanthin 
      and polyunsaturated fatty acids with health benefits. It can be used for the
      preparation of food emulsion, such as mayonnaise, with nutraceutical properties. 
      However, emulsion stability determines the quality of the emulsion. The use of
      protein (bovine serum albumin) in conjunction with polysaccharides, especially
      chitosan at appropriate concentrations, was proven to improve shrimp oil-in-water
      emulsion during extended storage. Additionally, chitosan can act as an
      antioxidant to prevent the degradation of astaxanthin to some extent. This
      finding could be potentially beneficial to produce emulsion with high stability
      using protein-chitosan complexes.

      effects of ionizing radiation on micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes
      (MnPCEs) in whole-body gamma-irradiated male BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice after oral
      administration of SJE. Results: SJE significantly inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome
      activation, reducing IL-1beta secretion in vitro. In addition, the frequency of
      MnPCEs was significantly lower in SJE-treated mice. Conclusions: SJE has
      anti-inflammatory effects and reduces radiation-induced chromosome damage.
      Advance in knowledge: There are no reports concerning the effects of SJE on NLRP3
      inflammasome activation or radioprotection. This experiment showed the
      radioprotective effects of saeu-jeot.

AB  - Fenneropenaeus chinensis is a migratory marine species with a suitable growth at 
      18-30 degrees C. To prolong breeding season and reduce mortality in winter,
      breeding new shrimp varieties with cold tolerance is essential. Genes upregulated
      and highly expressed at low temperature are reasonable candidate genetic markers 
      for the breeding of cold tolerant strain variants. This study screened genes with
      these features by comparing multiple low-vs. normal-temperature transcriptome
      groups. The results showed that nine genes were upregulated and highly expressed 
      at low temperature in more than seven of the nine comparison groups. Six of them 
      were identified as genes encoding transcription factor ATF2, RNA recognition
      motif domain-containing protein, cytochrome b5-like protein, troponin C, tubulin 
      alpha-1, and 18S/5.8S/28S rRNA, respectively. Cold-inducible upregulations of
      ATF2, cytochrome b5, and rRNAs were novel findings in this study. The other three
      novel genes were predicted to encode a membrane-bound extracellular protein and
      two lncRNAs. Four of the screened genes were verified by real time RT-PCR, and
      their expression levels were consistent with the sequencing results,
      demonstrating the accuracy of the transcriptome sequencing data. Function
      analysis showed that ATF2 might be the master transcription factor regulating the
      expressions of proteins involved in cellular responses to cold. The other genes
      played a role in events such as enhancing translation, increasing energy,
      inhibiting apoptosis, and preserving cell integrity. The expression features of
      these nine genes suggested that they were of great significance to the cold
      tolerance of shrimp.

AB  - To maintain the freshness of fruits and to meet environmental and consumer needs,
      a biobased packaging film with long-lasting antimicrobial activity was developed 
      in this article. Liquefied ball-milled shrimp shell chitin/polyvinyl alcohol
      (LBSC/PVA) blend films containing varying concentrations (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 wt%)
      of the beta-cyclodextrin/cinnamaldehyde (beta-CD/CA) inclusion were prepared and 
      characterized. The association between beta-CD and CA and the sustained release
      behavior of CA were explored. The physicochemical property, antimicrobial
      activity and food preservation performance of the films were investigated.
      Results showed that CA was successfully encapsulated into the cavity of CD by
      host-guest interactions, which greatly improved the sustained release of CA. The 
      3 wt% beta-CD/CA/LBSC/PVA blend film showed optimized mechanical properties with 
      a tensile strength of 41.5 MPa and an elongation at break of 810 %. In addition, 
      the incorporation of beta-CD/CA inclusion significantly enhanced the
      antimicrobial activity and food preservation performance of the blend films.
      Moreover, the 3 wt% beta-CD/CA/LBSC/PVA blend film exhibited evidently longer
      lasting antimicrobial activity and cherry tomato preservation performance than
      the 3 wt% CA/LBSC/PVA blend film, further demonstrating the critical role of
      beta-CD in delaying CA release. These novel beta-CD/CA/LBSC/PVA blend films may
      have a potential use in active food packaging.

TI  - Efficiency of Multiple Extraction Solvents on Antioxidant, Cytotoxic, and

      Valley, Azad Kashmir, Pakistan.
PG  - 5118553

AB  - Background: Different parts of Taraxacum officinale (L.) were used in traditional
      medicine in various parts of the world for the treatment of health problems, and 
      they possess significant biological activities. The present study aimed to
      estimate phytochemical and biological activities of T. officinale using different
      extraction solvents. Methods: Methanolic, acetone, and n-hexane extracts of
      selected species were prepared, and ten secondary metabolites were examined using
      standard protocols. The antioxidant activity was performed using three in vitro
      methods, namely, DPPH assay, total reducing power (TRP) assay, and total
      antioxidant capacity (TAC). Toxicological analysis was done using the brine
      shrimp cytotoxic assay and radish seed phytotoxic assay. Results: The T.
      officinale methanolic extract showed the highest phenolic (178.27 +/- 17.17
      mg/GAE/g) and flavonoid (18.50 +/- 1.64 mg QE/g) contents. Similarly, the
      methanolic extract also revealed the highest DPPH activity (32.80 +/- 9.66 IC50),
      reducing potential (0.53 +/- 0.02 mg/g), and TAC (19.42 +/- 0.97 mg/g) as
      compared to the acetone and n-hexane extracts. The Pearson correlation analysis
      confirmed a strong positive correlation (r > 0.9) between total phenolic content 
      (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and all antioxidant assays. Furthermore, a 
      heat map displayed the methanolic extract (red color) as a valuable source of
      phytochemicals and antioxidant agents. Moreover, the T. officinale methanolic
      extract also showed the highest (7.12 ppm) cytotoxic potential whereas both
      methanolic and acetone extracts were revealed as moderate phytotoxic agents when 
      compared with the standard. Conclusion: The T. officinale methanolic extract
      exhibited comparatively notable phytochemicals that are actively involved in
      antioxidant activities and possess toxicological properties. This upholds the
      folkloric use of T. officinale as a possible source to develop natural
      plant-based drugs. Further investigations to isolate bioactive compounds and
      elements and on their safety need to be conducted.

AB  - In vertebrate, MIP-T3 (microtubule-interacting protein associated with TRAF3)
      functions as a regulator of innate immune response that involves many cellular
      processes. However, the immune response regulated by shrimp (an arthropod) MIP-T3
      remains unrevealed. In the present study, a MIP-T3 homolog from shrimp
      Litopenaeus vannamei (named as LvMIP-T3) was cloned and identified. LvMIP-T3 had 
      a 2076 bp open reading frame (ORF), encoding a polypeptide of 691 amino acids
      that contained a classic coiled-coil domain in the C-terminal that showed a high 
      degree of conservation to other homologs. LvMIP-T3 could interact with LvTRAF6, a
      member of the canonical NF-kappaB pathway, but not LvTRAF3, which implies that
      LvMIP-T3 is able to regulate NF-kappaB activity via its interaction with LvTRAF6.
      In addition, LvMIP-T3 was substantially inducted in response to white spot
      syndrome virus (WSSV) challenge, and we demonstrated that LvMIP-T3 facilitated
      the expression of NF-kappaB-mediated several Penaeidins (antimicrobial peptides, 
      AMPs) to oppose infection. Taken together, we identified a MIP-T3 homolog from
      shrimp L. vannamei that played a positive role in the TRAF6/NF-kappaB/AMPs axis
      mediated defense response, which will contribute to better understand the
      regulator relationship among members of the canonical NF-kappaB pathway in
      shrimp, and provides some insights into disease resistance breeding.

AB  - Vibrio vulnificus is a zoonotic pathogen linked to aquaculture that is spreading 
      due to climate change. The pathogen can be transmitted to humans and animals by
      ingestion of raw shellfish or seafood feed, respectively. The aim of this work
      was to design and test a new procedure to detect V. vulnificus hazardous to human
      and/or animal health in food/feed samples. For this purpose, we combined a
      pre-enrichment step with multiplex PCR using primers for the species and for
      human and animal virulence markers. In vitro assays with mixed DNA from different
      Vibrio species and Vibrio cultures showed that the new protocol was 100% specific
      with a detection limit of 10cfu/mL. The protocol was successfully validated in
      seafood using artificially contaminated live shrimp and proved useful also in
      pathogen isolation from animals and their ecosystem. In conclusion, this novel
      protocol could be applied in health risk studies associated with food/feed
      consumption, as well as in the routine identification and subtyping of V.
      vulnificus from environmental or clinical samples.

AB  - Trained immunity is driven by metabolism and epigenetics in innate immune cells
      in mammals. The phenomenon of trained immunity has been identified in
      invertebrates, including shrimp, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To
      elucidate mechanisms of trained immunity in shrimp, the metabolomic changes in
      hemolymph of Marsupenaeus japonicus trained by the UV-inactivated white spot
      syndrome virus (UV-WSSV) were analyzed using tandem gas chromatography-mass/mass 
      spectrometry. The metabolomic profiles of shrimp trained with UV-WSSV followed
      WSSV infection showed significant differences comparison with the control groups,
      PBS injection followed WSSV infection. 16 differential metabolites in total of
      154 metabolites were identified, including D-fructose-6-phosphate,
      D-glucose-6-phosphate, and D-fructose-6-phosphate, and metabolic pathways,
      glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, and AMPK signaling pathway were enriched
      in the UV-WSSV trained groups. Further study found that histone monomethylation
      and trimethylation at H3K4 (H3K4me1 and H3K4me3) were involved in the trained
      immunity. Our data suggest that the UV-WSSV induced trained immunity leads to
      metabolism reprogramming in the shrimp and provide insights for WSSV control in
      shrimp aquaculture.

AB  - This study discussed the effects of two types of lactic acid bacteria,
      Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) and Pediococcus acidilactici (P.
      acidilactici), on the growth and nonspecific immunity of Penaeus vannamei (P.
      vannamei) and developed probiotic applications for shrimp cultivation. This study
      incorporated two types of lactic acid bacteria in shrimp feed through spraying.
      The shrimps were grouped according to the type and concentration of effective
      bacteria incorporated into their feed. This research was separated into 3
      individual feeding treatment as control, L. reuteri (Lr groups) and P.
      acidilactici (Pa groups). The shrimp was feeding with 10(3), 10(5), and 10(7)
      cfu/feed (g) L. reuteri namely as Lr3, Lr5, and Lr7. The shrimp was feeding with 
      10(3), 10(5), and 10(7) cfu/feed (g) P. acidilactici were named Pa3, Pa5, and
      Pa7, respectively. Through 8 weeks of feeding, the results revealed that the use 
      of shrimp feed incorporated with lactic acid bacteria did not cause negative
      effects on water quality. The testing items include ammonia-nitrogen
      concentration, nitrite-nitrogen concentration, and total vibrio count in the
      water. In addition, the lactic acid bacteria concentration in the water were in
      the range of 1.33 +/- 0.58 x 10(1) to 9.77 +/- 1.34 x 10(2) cfu/mL. Observations 
      of the growth performance of the white shrimps after 8 weeks of feeding revealed 
      that both bacteria were beneficial to shrimp growth. In particular, group Lr7 had
      the highest percentage weight gain (107.99 +/- 3.92%), special growth rate (1.93 
      +/- 0.07%), feed conversion ratio (3.34 +/- 0.05), and survival rate (97.22 +/-
      4.81%). Furthermore, observations of the nonspecific immunity reactions of the
      white shrimps after 4 weeks of feeding indicated that on day 4, the total number 
      of haemocyte in shrimps in groups Lr5, Lr7, Pa3, and Pa5 significantly increased.
      On days 1 and 4, the phenoloxidase activity and superoxide axion production rates
      of the Lr group and Ls group increased. This phenomenon was the most significant 
      in group Lr7, and the effect continued until day 28. After day 7, the phagocytic 
      rate of groups Lr5 and Lr7 significantly increased. In addition, Lr and Pa groups
      exhibited significant increases in the phagocytic index after days 4 and 14,
      respectively. This phenomenon was also the most significant in group Lr7.

AB  - Copepods, including Apocyclops royi, are small aquatic crustaceans and one of the
      important foods for fish and shellfish larvae. However, studies of the
      host-pathogen interactions and understanding of infectious disease in copepods
      are still very limited, yet they are likely to be a significant factor in the
      sustainable development of copepod aquaculture. In the present study, we
      performed de novo RNA sequence analysis of A. royi-TH (a Thai isolate of A.
      royi), which yielded 4.80 Gb bases of clean data and a total of 29,786 unigenes. 
      Annotation was then performed by comparison against seven functional databases,
      yielding 17,617 (NR: 59.15%), 2,969 (NT: 9.97%), 15,023 (SwissProt: 50.44%),
      14,543 (KOG: 48.82%), 15,077 (KEGG: 50.62%), 6,763(GO: 22.71%), and 15,841
      (InterPro: 53.18%) unigenes. In comparison to the components of the shrimp Toll
      pathway, LGBP, Spatzle, Toll receptors, MyD88, Pelle, TRAF6, Dorsal, and Cactus
      homologs were successfully identified in A. royi-TH. Additionally, a novel
      antimicrobial peptide (Theromacin-like) was characterized in A. royi (ArTM-like).
      The ArTM-like ORF was 279 bp and predicted to encode for 92 amino acid residues, 
      with a mature peptide of 75 amino acids and a molecular mass of 8.56 kDa. The
      genomic organization of the ArTM-like gene consisted of three exons and two
      introns. Expression analysis indicated that ArTM-like mRNA was abundantly
      expressed in copepodid and adult stages as an immune responsive gene after
      infection with the pathogenic Vibrio parahaemolyticus-(AHPND)-causing strain.
      Altogether, the knowledge obtained in this study will provide a basis for future 
      functional studies of the molecular mechanisms in copepod immunity that may
      eventually be applied for disease prevention in copepod aquaculture.

AB  - Retaining the traditional flavor while shortening the fermentation cycle is the
      current research focus for shrimp paste fermentation technology. The present
      study investigated the effect of combined use of halophilic bacteria as starters 
      on the sensory and flavor characteristics of rapidly fermented shrimp paste.
      Sensory evaluation indicated that the starter-inoculated samples had high
      texture, appearance, and overall quality scores. Headspace gas chromatography-ion
      mobility spectrometry/mass spectrometry (HS-GC-IMS/MS) identified 95 volatile
      compounds, the fingerprint profiles of the starter-inoculated samples were
      similar to those of the traditional sample. Notably, the content of benzaldehyde,
      phenylethylaldehyde, and 3-methylbutyraldehyde increased significantly in the
      starter-inoculated samples (p < 0.05), which may provide an intense malt,
      caramel, and pleasant odor. Although the content of certain flavor substances in 
      the starter-inoculated samples was lower than those of traditional sample, the
      use significantly reduced the fermentation time and mimicked the flavor profile
      of traditional shrimp paste to some extent.

TI  - Traditional Uses, Phytochemistry and Biological Activities of Alocasia Species: A
      Systematic Review.
PG  - 849704
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2022.849704 [doi]
AB  - The genus Alocasia (Schott) G. Don consists of 113 species distributed across
      Asia, Southeast Asia, and Australia. Alocasia plants grow in tropical and
      subtropical forests with humid lowlands. Featuring their large green heart-shaped
      or arrow-shaped ear leaves and occasionally red-orange fruit, they are very
      popular ornamental plants and are widely used as traditional medicines to treat
      various diseases such as jaundice, snake bite, boils, and diabetes. This
      manuscript critically analysed the distribution, traditional uses, and
      phytochemical contents of 96 species of Alocasia. The numerous biological
      activities of Alocasia species were also presented, which include anti-cancer,
      antidiabetic and antihyperglycaemic, antioxidant, antidiarrhoea, antimicrobial
      and antifungal, antiparasitic (antiprotozoal and anthelminthic), antinociceptive 
      and anti-inflammatory, brine shrimp lethality, hepatoprotective,
      anti-hemagglutinin, anti-constipation and diuretic, and radioprotective
      activities as well as acute toxicity studies. Research articles were acquired by 
      the accessing three scientific databases comprising PubMed, Scopus, and Google
      Scholar. For this review, specific information was obtained using the general
      search term "Alocasia", followed by the "plant species names" and "phytochemical"
      or "bioactivity" or "pharmacological activity". The accepted authority of the
      plant species was referred from theplantlist.org. Scientific studies have
      revealed that the genus is mainly scattered throughout Asia. It has broad
      traditional benefits, which have been associated with various biological
      properties such as cytotoxic, antihyperglycaemic, antimicrobial, and
      anti-inflammatory. Alocasia species exhibit diverse biological activities that
      are very useful for medical treatment. The genus Alocasia was reported to be able
      to produce a strong and high-quality anti-cancer compound, namely alocasgenoside 
      B, although information on this compound is currently limited. Therefore, it is
      strongly recommended to further explore the relevant use of natural compounds
      present in the genus Alocasia, particularly as an anti-cancer agent. With only a 
      few Alocasia species that have been scientifically studied so far, more attention
      and effort is required to establish the link between traditional uses, active
      compounds, and pharmacological activities of various species of this genus.

AB  - Chitin is a natural biopolymer obtained from the exoskeleton of crustaceans.
      Chitosan is a derivative of chitin, which has antimicrobial properties and
      potential applications in several industries. Moreover, the composites of
      chitosan with other biodegradable polymers, such as polylactide (PLA) as
      packaging film, have shown promising results. In this study, chitosan was
      obtained and characterized from shrimp shells. Then, polylactide-chitosan
      composite films were prepared by a solvent casting technique using various
      amounts of chitosan (0.5-2% w/w) and polyethylene glycol as plasticizer (10%
      w/w). Thermal, mechanical properties, Fourier-transform infrared, scanning
      electron microscopy, as well as antibacterial properties of composite films were 
      determined. It was found that adding chitosan (CH) into PLA films has a
      significant effect on tensile strength and no effect on thermal properties. The
      results showed a reduction on average of 1 log of colony-forming units against
      Staphylococcus aureus, while there is no antibacterial effect against Salmonella 
      typhimurium. The study proved the antibacterial effect of CH in films of PLA
      against Gram-positive bacteria and appropriate mechanical properties. These films
      could be used for the development of biodegradable/eco-friendly food packaging
      prototypes, as a potential solution to replace conventional non-degradable
      packaging materials.

TI  - Structure of the cytoplasmic ring of the Xenopus laevis nuclear pore complex.
PG  - eabl8280
LID - 10.1126/science.abl8280 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION The nuclear pore complex (NPC) resides on the nuclear envelope (NE) 
      and mediates nucleocytoplasmic cargo transport. As one of the largest cellular
      machineries, a vertebrate NPC consists of cytoplasmic filaments, a cytoplasmic
      ring (CR), an inner ring, a nuclear ring, a nuclear basket, and a luminal ring.
      Each NPC has eight repeating subunits. Structure determination of NPC is a
      prerequisite for understanding its functional mechanism. In the past two decades,
      integrative modeling, which combines x-ray structures of individual nucleoporins 
      and subcomplexes with cryo-electron tomography reconstructions, has played a
      crucial role in advancing our knowledge about the NPC. The CR has been a major
      focus of structural investigation. The CR subunit of human NPC was reconstructed 
      by cryo-electron tomography through subtomogram averaging to an overall
      resolution of ~20 A, with local resolution up to ~15 A. Each CR subunit comprises
      two Y-shaped multicomponent complexes known as the inner and outer Y complexes.
      Eight inner and eight outer Y complexes assemble in a head-to-tail fashion to
      form the proximal and distal rings, respectively, constituting the CR scaffold.
      To achieve higher resolution of the CR, we used single-particle cryo-electron
      microscopy (cryo-EM) to image the intact NPC from the NE of Xenopus laevis
      oocytes. Reconstructions of the core region and the Nup358 region of the X.
      laevis CR subunit had been achieved at average resolutions of 5 to 8 A, allowing 
      identification of secondary structural elements. RATIONALE Packing interactions
      among the components of the CR subunit were poorly defined by all previous EM
      maps. Additional components of the CR subunit are strongly suggested by the EM
      maps of 5- to 8-A resolution but remain to be identified. Addressing these issues
      requires improved resolution of the cryo-EM reconstruction. Therefore, we may
      need to enhance sample preparation, optimize image acquisition, and develop an
      effective data-processing strategy. RESULTS To reduce conformational
      heterogeneity of the sample, we spread the opened NE onto the grids with minimal 
      force and used the chemical cross-linker glutaraldehyde to stabilize the NPC. To 
      alleviate orientation bias of the NPC, we tilted sample grids and imaged the
      sample with higher electron dose at higher angles. We improved the
      image-processing protocol. With these efforts, the average resolutions for the
      core and the Nup358 regions have been improved to 3.7 and 4.7 A, respectively.
      The highest local resolution of the core region reaches 3.3 A. In addition, a
      cryo-EM structure of the N-terminal alpha-helical domain of Nup358 has been
      resolved at 3.0-A resolution. These EM maps allow the identification of five
      copies of Nup358, two copies of Nup93, two copies of Nup205, and two copies of Y 
      complexes in each CR subunit. Relying on the EM maps and facilitated by AlphaFold
      prediction, we have generated a final model for the CR of the X. laevis NPC. Our 
      model of the CR subunit includes 19,037 amino acids in 30 nucleoporins. A
      previously unknown C-terminal fragment of Nup160 was found to constitute a key
      part of the vertex, in which the short arm, long arm, and stem of the Y complex
      meet. The Nup160 C-terminal fragment directly binds the beta-propeller proteins
      Seh1 and Sec13. Two Nup205 molecules, which do not contact each other, bind the
      inner and outer Y complexes through distinct interfaces. Conformational
      elasticity of the two Nup205 molecules may underlie their versatility in binding 
      to different nucleoporins in the proximal and distal CR rings. Two Nup93
      molecules, each comprising an N-terminal extended helix and an ACE1 domain,
      bridge the Y complexes and Nup205. Nup93 and Nup205 together play a critical role
      in mediating the contacts between neighboring CR subunits. Five Nup358 molecules,
      each in the shape of a shrimp tail and named "the clamp," hold the stems of both 
      Y complexes. The innate conformational elasticity allows each Nup358 clamp to
      adapt to a distinct local environment for optimal interactions with neighboring
      nucleoporins. In each CR subunit, the alpha-helical nucleoporins appear to
      provide the conformational elasticity; the 12 beta-propellers may strengthen the 
      scaffold. CONCLUSION Our EM map-based model of the X. laevis CR subunit
      substantially expands the molecular mass over the reported composite models of
      vertebrate CR subunit. In addition to the Y complexes, five Nup358, two Nup205,
      and two Nup93 molecules constitute the key components of the CR. The improved EM 
      maps reveal insights into the interfaces among the nucleoporins of the CR.

AB  - A global crisis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has impacted millions of
      people's lives throughout the world. In parallel to vaccine development,
      identifying potential antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 has become an urgent
      need to combat COVID-19. One of the most attractive drug targets for discovering 
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents is the main protease (M(pro)), which plays a pivotal role 
      in the viral life cycle. This study aimed to elucidate a series of twenty-one
      12-dithiocarbamate-14-deoxyandrographolide analogues as SARS-CoV-2 M(pro)
      inhibitors using in vitro and in silico studies. These compounds were initially
      screened for the inhibitory activity toward SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) by in vitro
      enzyme-based assay. We found that compounds 3 k, 3 l, 3 m and 3 t showed
      promising inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) with >50% inhibition at
      10 muM. Afterward, the binding mode of each compound in the active site of
      SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) was explored by molecular docking. The optimum docked complexes
      were then chosen and subjected to molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The MD
      results suggested that all studied complexes were stable along the simulation
      time, and most of the compounds could fit well with the SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) active 
      site, particularly at S1, S2 and S4 subsites. The per-residue decomposition free 
      energy calculations indicated that the hot-spot residues essential for ligand
      binding were T25, H41, C44, S46, M49, C145, H163, M165, E166, L167, D187, R188,
      Q189 and T190. Therefore, the obtained information from the combined experimental
      and computational techniques could lead to further optimization of more specific 
      and potent andrographolide analogues toward SARS-CoV-2 M(pro).

TI  - Seasonal and Spatial Comparison of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Among Decapod
      Shrimp from Coastal Portugal.
LID - 10.1007/s00128-022-03562-y [doi]
AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous global pollutants that are
      lipophilic, bioaccumulative and can be both endocrine disruptors and carcinogens.
      In this study, we measured 18 PAHs among decapod shrimp samples (Palaemon spp.)
      collected during the spring and autumn from multiple locations along the
      Portuguese coastal, including local markets and aquaculture farms. SigmaPAH
      concentrations in samples ranged from 3.14 to 320.48 ng/g (ww) with the highest
      value in this range detected in a sample provided from an aquaculture facility.
      Fifteen of the 18 scanned PAHs were present in shrimp samples. However,
      detectable concentrations (0.07 ng/g ww) of the carcinogenic benzo-a-pyrene
      occurred for a single sample only and approached method detection limits. No
      significant differences in shrimp SigmaPAH concentrations were evident between
      the spring and autumn seasons. Target hazard quotient estimation suggested low
      probability of adverse health effects to consumers through consumption of shrimp 
      from the study collection locations.

TI  - Dietary supplementation with Pediococcus pentosaceus enhances the innate immune
      response in and promotes growth of Litopenaeus vannamei shrimp.
LID - 10.1111/jfd.13666 [doi]
AB  - To reach the sustainable development goals on health management in Litopenaeus
      vannamei shrimp culture, Pediococcus pentosaceus AB01 was supplemented in shrimp 
      diet. In this study, the control diet and three experimental diets containing P. 
      pentosaceus AB01 (10(8) , 10(9) , 10(10) CFU/g) were separately introduced to L. 
      vannamei for a 28 days feeding trial. After the feeding trial, percent weight
      gain, feeding efficiency, and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were significantly
      elevated in L. vannamei administered with P. pentosaceus AB01 at 10(9) and 10(10)
      colony-forming unit (CFU)/g. Protease, amylase, and trypsin were found at higher 
      levels in the probiotic-supplied groups. The feeding of shrimps with P.
      pentosaceus AB01 significantly increased innate immune response and levels of
      related biochemical parameters in the haemolymph. After the white spot syndrome
      virus (WSSV) challenge, supplementation of P. pentosaceus AB01 had significant
      positive effects (p < .05) on survival rate, compared to that of the control
      diet. The higher resistance of L. vannamei to WSSV might have been due to
      alterations in the gut microbiome composition and upregulation of the Toll-Like
      Receptor (TLR) signalling pathway. Hence, P. pentosaceus AB01 may be a promising 
      alternative feed to promote growth rate, modulate microbiota composition, and
      enhance immunity in L. vannamei shrimp.

TI  - Exploring the Applications of Carbon-Detected NMR in Living and Dead Organisms
      Using a (13)C-Optimized Comprehensive Multiphase NMR Probe.
PG  - 8756-8765
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.2c01356 [doi]
AB  - Comprehensive multiphase-nuclear magnetic resonance (CMP-NMR) is a non-invasive
      approach designed to observe all phases (solutions, gels, and solids) in intact
      samples using a single NMR probe. Studies of dead and living organisms are
      important to understand processes ranging from biological growth to environmental
      stress. Historically, such studies have utilized (1)H-based phase editing for the
      detection of soluble/swollen components and (1)H-detected 2D NMR for metabolite
      assignments/screening. However, living organisms require slow spinning rates (
      approximately 500 Hz) to increase survivability, but at such low speeds,
      complications from water sidebands and spectral overlap from the modest chemical 
      shift window ( approximately 0-10 ppm) make (1)H NMR challenging. Here, a novel
      (13)C-optimized E-Free magic angle spinning CMP probe is applied to study all
      phases in ex vivo and in vivo samples. This probe consists of a two-coil design, 
      with an inner single-tuned (13)C coil providing a 113% increase in (13)C
      sensitivity relative to a traditional multichannel single-CMP coil design. For
      organisms with a large biomass ( approximately 0.1 g) like the Ganges River sprat
      (ex vivo), (13)C-detected full spectral editing and (13)C-detected heteronuclear 
      correlation (HETCOR) can be performed at natural abundance. Unfortunately, for a 
      single living shrimp ( approximately 2 mg), (13)C enrichment was still required, 
      but (13)C-detected HETCOR shows superior data relative to heteronuclear
      single-quantum coherence at low spinning speeds (due to complications from water 
      sidebands in the latter). The probe is equipped with automatic-tuning-matching
      and is compatible with automated gradient shimming horizontal line a key step
      toward conducting multiphase screening of dead and living organisms under
      automation in the near future.

TI  - Salinity-dependent modulation by protein kinases and the FXYD2 peptide of gill

AB  - The geographical distribution of aquatic crustaceans is determined by ambient
      factors like salinity that modulate their biochemistry, physiology, behavior,
      reproduction, development and growth. We investigated the effects of exogenous
      pig FXYD2 peptide and endogenous protein kinases A and C on gill (Na(+),
      K(+))-ATPase activity, and characterized enzyme kinetic properties in a
      freshwater population of Macrobrachium amazonicum in fresh water (<0.5 per
      thousand salinity) or acclimated to 21 per thousandS. Stimulation by FXYD2
      peptide and inhibition by endogenous kinase phosphorylation are
      salinity-dependent. While without effect in shrimps in fresh water, the FXYD2
      peptide stimulated activity in salinity-acclimated shrimps by approximately 50 %.
      PKA-mediated phosphorylation inhibited gill (Na(+), K(+))-ATPase activity by 85 %
      in acclimated shrimps while PKC phosphorylation markedly inhibited enzyme
      activity in freshwater- and salinity-acclimated shrimps. The (Na(+), K(+))-ATPase
      in salinity-acclimated shrimp gills hydrolyzed ATP at a Vmax of 54.9 +/- 1.8 nmol
      min(-1) mg(-1) protein, corresponding to approximately 60 % that of freshwater
      shrimps. Mg(2+) affinity increased with salinity acclimation while K(+) affinity 
      decreased. (Ca(2+), Mg(2+))-ATPase activity increased while V(H(+))- and Na(+)-
      or K(+)-stimulated activities decreased on salinity acclimation. The 120-kDa
      immunoreactive band expressed in salinity-acclimated shrimps suggests nonspecific
      alpha-subunit phosphorylation by PKA and/or PKC. These alterations in (Na(+),
      K(+))-ATPase kinetics in salinity-acclimated M. amazonicum may result from
      regulatory mechanisms mediated by phosphorylation via protein kinases A and C and
      the FXYD2 peptide rather than through the expression of a different alpha-subunit
      isoform. This is the first demonstration of gill (Na(+), K(+))-ATPase regulation 
      by protein kinases in freshwater shrimps during salinity challenge.

AB  - The life history traits of the snapping shrimp Alpheus carlae were investigated. 
      We evaluated the relative growth, morphological sexual maturity, sexual
      dimorphism, handedness, fecundity, and egg volume. Sampling was performed monthly
      in an estuarine region of Cananeia, in the south-eastern coast of Brazil. The
      following structures were measured to perform the relative growth analysis:
      length of carapace and second pleonal pleuron, length, width and height of major 
      cheliped propodus, and length of appendix interna and appendix masculina.
      Juveniles and adults males and females have different growth patterns, indicating
      distinct strategies of energy allocation. The estimated carapace length at the
      onset of morphological sexual maturity of females and males was 5.6 mm and 6.2
      mm, respectively. The sexual dimorphism of specific body structures was evident, 
      mainly in the appendix interna of females and major cheliped of males. There was 
      no evidence of handedness in females or males. The mean fecundity of females was 
      364 +/- 204 eggs (mean +/- SD) eggs and was positively correlated with the
      carapace length. The egg volume differed between developmental stages I and II,
      and I and III, with an overall volume increase of 73.23% and 95.45%,
      respectively. The results contribute to the knowledge about A. carlae and its
      life history in natural environment.

TI  - Trends in Stroke Kinematics, Reynolds Number, and Swimming Mode in Shrimp-Like
      Organisms.
LID - icac067 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/icb/icac067 [doi]
AB  - Metachronal propulsion is commonly seen in organisms with the caridoid facies
      body plan, i.e. shrimp-like organisms, as they beat their pleopods in an
      adlocomotory sequence. These organisms exist across length scales ranging several
      orders of Reynolds number magnitude, from 10 to 104, during locomotion. Further, 
      by altering their stroke kinematics, these organisms achieve three distinct
      swimming modes. To better understand the relationship between Reynolds number,
      stroke kinematics, and resulting swimming mode, Euphausia pacifica stroke
      kinematics were quantified using high-speed digital recordings and compared to
      the results for the larger E. superba. Euphausia pacifica consistently operate
      with a greater beat frequency and smaller stroke amplitude than E. superba for
      each swimming mode, suggesting that length scale may affect the kinematics needed
      to achieve similar swimming modes. To expand on this observation, these
      euphausiid data are used in combination with previously-published stroke
      kinematics from mysids and stomatopods to identify broad trends across swimming
      mode and length scale in metachrony. Principal component analysis (PCA) reveals
      trends in stroke kinematics and Reynolds number as well as the variation among
      taxonomic order. Overall, larger beat frequencies, stroke amplitudes,
      between-cycle phase lags, and Reynolds numbers are more representative of the
      fast forward swimming mode compared to the slower hovering mode. Additionally,
      each species has a unique combination of kinematics that result in metachrony,
      indicating that there are other factors, perhaps morphological, which affect the 
      overall metachronal characteristics of an organism. Finally, uniform phase lag,
      in which the timing between power strokes of all pleopods is equal, in 5-paddle
      systems is achieved at different Reynolds numbers for different swimming modes,
      highlighting the importance of taking into consideration stroke kinematics,
      length scale, and the resulting swimming mode.

      parahaemolyticus.

AB  - Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a common foodborne pathogenic bacterium and
      drug-resistant strains are now widespread. Phages led by drug-resistant V.
      parahaemolyticus strains are promising means to decrease the pressure on public
      health. We isolated a V. parahaemolyticus-specific bacteriophage F23s1 that was
      active at wide ranges of temperature (30-60 degrees C) and pH (4-10). Phage F23s1
      exhibited a specific host range; in that, only 13 of the 23 V. parahaemolyticus
      strains were lysed. F23s1 effectively inhibited the growth of V. parahaemolyticus
      strain F23 in shrimp at 25 degrees C within 12 h at a multiplicity of infection
      of 1000. We sequenced the genome of phage F23s1 which comprised a 76,648-bp DNA
      with 105 open reading frames (ORFs) and identified an endolysin gene ORF52 that
      was then cloned and successfully expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant
      ORF52 protein significantly decreased OD600 nm of V. parahaemolyticus F23 from
      0.978 to 0.249 when used at 20 micromol/L within 60 min. The endolysin also
      showed lytic activity against a panel of 23 drug-resistant V. parahaemolyticus
      and 12 Salmonella strains with a higher lytic ability for V. parahaemolyticus.
      The phage F23s1 and its endolysin will be useful for preventing and controlling
      V. parahaemolyticus in food safety.

AB  - To monitor the freshness of Penaeus vannamei during storage, a colorimetric film 
      based on sodium alginate/sodium carboxymethyl cellulose incorporated with rose
      anthocyanins extract (RAE) was prepared. The results showed that the
      incorporation of RAE increased moisture content, water vapor permeability, and
      water contact angle of the colorimetric film. FTIR, XRD spectra, and SEM
      demonstrated that RAE had good compatibility with the film-forming substrate. The
      colorimetric film presented obvious color variation in the pH range of 2.0-12.0
      and was sensitive to volatile ammonia. The colorimetric film exhibited a visual
      color change from pink to pale yellow to yellowish green during the storage of
      Penaeus vannamei at 4 degrees C. Significant correlations were observed between
      the color change of colorimetric film (DeltaE) and the pH value or TVB-N content 
      of Penaeus vannamei (p < 0.05). Therefore, the colorimetric film shows great
      application potential to monitor the freshness of shrimp as intelligent
      packaging.

AB  - Serine proteases are proteolytic enzymes that exhibit biological roles in many
      biological systems. Previously, a Vibrio parahaemolyticus serine protease was
      reported to be a virulence factor. Here, the serine protease gene of V.
      parahaemolyticus was investigated as a DNA vaccine against V. parahaemolyticus in
      Litopenaeus vannamei. The serine protease gene was mutated to replace the
      conserved residues His82, Asp131 and Ser231 with Gly, Asp and Pro, respectively. 
      Then, a pcDNA3.1 vector to express mutVpSP (mutant serine protease) was
      constructed for in vitro and in vivo DNA vaccine investigation. In vivo mutVpSP
      transcriptional analysis revealed expression in various immunized white shrimp
      tissues, such as hemocytes, hepatopancreas, stomach, intestine, gills, and
      muscle. The efficiency of prevention of V. parahaemolyticus infection was
      investigated in vaccinated shrimp, and the lowest cumulative mortality percentage
      was 30%, while the control shrimp had a 60% cumulative mortality rate. The immune
      system was stimulated in shrimp vaccinated with the DNA vaccine. The mRNA
      expression of the shrimp immune-responsive genes phenoloxidase, peroxinectin and 
      C-type lectin was significantly upregulated. Additionally, the humoral and
      cellular immune responses, including the PO, phagocytic, and encapsulation
      activities and nodule formation, were elevated. These results suggested that the 
      serine protease could be a V. parahaemolyticus virulence determinant and that
      this DNA vaccine could be applied as an effective vaccine candidate for control
      of acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease syndrome (AHPND) in shrimp.

AB  - Raw materials for making dried shrimp (a type of foodstuff) are mostly from
      farmed shrimp and preliminary findings indicated that head copper (Cu)
      concentrations in some commercial dried shrimp products exceeded the safe limit
      specified in pollution-free aquatic products (50 mg/kg), which may influence food
      safety. Therefore, a 63-day feeding trial was conducted to explore effects of
      dietary Cu concentrations on accumulation of Cu in tissues, growth performance,
      immune response and antioxidant status of Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus
      vannamei). Moderating effect of myo-inositol (MI, adding 200 mg/kg diet) on the
      adverse impacts caused by excessive dietary Cu was also investigated. 600 shrimp 
      (initial weight: 0.89 +/- 0.00 g) were divided into five groups: 37.08 mg Cu/kg
      diet group (control group), 62.57 mg Cu/kg diet group, 125.99 mg Cu/kg diet
      group, 63.41 mg Cu/kg diet group (supplemented with MI) and 119.19 mg Cu/kg diet 
      group (supplemented with MI). The results showed that dietary Cu concentrations
      increased from 37.08 to over 62.57 mg/kg, hepatopancreas Cu concentrations raised
      from 29.04 to 233.43-263.65 mg/kg, and muscle Cu concentrations only increased
      from 6.22 to 6.99-8.39 mg/kg. Report to control group, excessive Cu concentration
      (125.99 mg/kg) didn't significantly affect growth performance, but it notably
      reduced whole body lipid content and immune response, induced oxidative stress
      and damaged the hepatopancreas structure, which was ameliorated by MI
      supplementation. The results suggested that consuming shrimp head and its
      processed products weren't recommended. Cu concentrations of commercial feeds for
      Pacific white shrimp should be controlled below 62.57 mg/kg. Additionally, MI
      supplementation mitigated the negative impacts induced by excessive dietary Cu.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effect of completely or partially
      replacing fresh foods from the broodstock diet with an experimental diet. During 
      a 40-day period, three dietary treatments were tested on Litopeaneus vannamei
      broodstock. As part of the first dietary treatment, denoted as "FF", broodstock
      shrimp were fed only fresh frozen food (squid, polychaete, mussel and Artemia
      biomass). The second treatment denoted as "ED" was 100% an artificial
      experimental diet. The third treatment, denoted as MD, comprised both the
      experimental diet and the fresh-frozen food (only squid and mussel were used). In
      terms of fertile spawns, females with >/= 1 spawn, females with >/= 2 spawn, and 
      fecundity, the MD treatment did not differ significantly from the FF treatment.
      Fecundity was lowest among females receiving the ED treatment. MD treatment
      demonstrated equivalent fertility in females, and sperm rate in males to that of 
      the FF treatment. The highest normal sperm rate was found in the ED and MD
      treatments. As a result, a combination of fresh food and the experimental diet
      resulted in a more balanced reproduction performance.

AB  - White feces syndrome (WFS) in cultivated shrimp is characterized by white shrimp 
      midguts (intestines) and white fecal strings that float as mats on pond surfaces.
      The etiology of WFS is complex, but one type called EHP-WFS is associated with
      the microsporidian Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP). The hepatopancreas (HP),
      midgut and fecal strings of EHP-WFS shrimp exhibit massive quantities of EHP
      spores together with mixed, unidentified bacteria. In EHP-WFS ponds, some
      EHP-infected shrimp show white midguts (WG) and produce white feces while other
      EHP-infected shrimp in the same pond show grossly normal midguts (NG) and produce
      no white feces. We hypothesized that comparison of the microbial flora between WG
      and NG shrimp would reveal probable combinations of microbes significantly
      associated with EHP-WFS. To test this, we selected a Penaeus vannamei cultivation
      pond exhibiting severe WFS and used microscopic and microbial profiling analyses 
      to compare WG and NG samples. Histologically, EHP was confirmed in the HP and
      midgut of both WG and NG shrimp, but EHP burdens were higher and EHP tissue
      damage was more severe in WG shrimp. Further, intestinal microbiomes in WG shrimp
      were less diverse and had higher abundance of bacteria from the genera Vibrio and
      Propionigenium. Propionigenium burden in the HP of WG shrimp (9364 copies/100 ng 
      DNA) was significantly higher (P = 1.1 x 10(-5)) than in NG shrimp (12 copies/100
      ng DNA). These findings supported our hypothesis by revealing two candidate
      bacterial genera that should be tested in combination with EHP as potential
      component causes of EHP-WFS in P. vannamei.

AB  - Meiotic recombination 11 (MRE11), a key component of the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN)
      complex, plays important roles in damaged DNA repair and immune response. In this
      study, we described the molecular cloning of a new member of MRE11 from
      Litopenaeus vannamei named as LvMRE11. The full length of LvMRE11 was 2999 bp,
      including a 1947 bp open reading frame (ORF) that encoded a putative protein of
      648 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of approximately 73.2kDa
      LvMRE11 was universally expressed in all tested tissues and its expression in
      intestine was responsive to the challenge of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV),
      poly (I: C), poly [dA:dT], CpG-ODN 2006 and IFN stimulatory DNA (ISD). The
      dsRNA-mediated knockdown of LvMRE11 enhanced the susceptibility of shrimps to
      WSSV infection, as manifested by a higher mortality and viral loads observed in
      LvMRE11 silenced shrimps. Besides, silencing of LvMRE11 resulted in decreased
      expression levels of IRF-Vago-JAK/STAT pathway components, and Dorsal but not the
      Relish, as well as several antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). In conclusion, we
      provided some evidences that the involvement of LvMRE11 in innate immune against 
      virus infection probably through regulating the IRF and Dorsal mediated antiviral
      pathways.

AB  - Human consumption of the thornback guitarfish (Platyrhinoidis triseriata) is
      concentrated in coastal populations of the Pacific coast of Mexico as its meat is
      prized for its high quality. This study analyzes the distribution of mercury and 
      selenium in the muscle and liver of Platyrhinoidis triseriata and the risk to
      human health associated with its consumption. In order to conduct these
      estimates, specimens were collected from the Eastern Pacific Ocean in 2015 and
      2016 and found mean concentrations (microg g(-1) wet weight) of mercury ranging
      from 0.02 to 0.58 in muscle and 0.10 to 0.31 in liver. Selenium ranged from 0.14 
      to 1.31 in muscle and from 0.93 to 4.52 in liver. Mercury levels in the muscle of
      P. triseriata were significantly correlated (positive correlation) with the total
      length of the specimens. The predominant prey of P. triseriata was the shrimp
      Pleuroncodes planipes and according to the biomagnification factor, only mercury 
      was biomagnified. The risk to consumers associated with the simultaneous presence
      of mercury and selenium in the muscle and liver of rays under the selenium health
      benefit value approach indicated that consumption of P. triseriata from this area
      is beneficial to human health.

AB  - The edible brown seaweed, Sargassum polycystum C. Agardh was harvested from the
      coastal region of Malaysia. In this study, analysis of the nutrition and metal
      content in the methanol extract showed positive for sodium, potassium, magnesium,
      vitamins A and E and arsenic contamination. The brine shrimp lethality assay
      (BSLA) revealed the extract to be non-toxic with LC50 value of 15.60 mg mL(-1)
      (LC50 > 1). The antioxidant and antibacterial activities of the methanol extract 
      were measured through various bioassays. The structural and physicochemical
      characterisation of the NaAlg, analysed through the (1)H-NMR analysis revealed
      the M:G ratio of NaAlg at 0.733 with mannuronic (M) and guluronic (G) fractions
      at F M = 0.423 and F G = 0.577, respectively. The degraded NaAlg through methods 
      of ultraviolet irradiation and sonication showed an increment in the in vivo
      antioxidant activities at intervals of 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min and 120
      min. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra of
      polysaccharides taken before and after UV irradiation showed breakage of covalent
      bonds and thus, increase in the intensity of both O-H and C-O stretching
      vibrations. Therefore, the increment in antioxidant activities observed in the
      treated samples were related to changes seen in their molecular structures.

TI  - Addition of Molasses Ameliorates Water and Bio-Floc Quality in Shrimp Pond Water.
PG  - 121-141
LID - 10.21315/tlsr2022.33.1.8 [doi]
AB  - Suspended particulate matter, phytoplankton and bacteria can be exploited to form
      larger aggregates, so-called bio-flocs. These serve as feeds for cultured
      shrimps, govern inorganic nutrients and load bacteria including pathogens. The
      current study aimed to simulate aggregate formation from available particulate
      matter in shrimp pond water and investigate quality of aggregates as well as
      possible impact to the pond water. Molasses was added to cylindrical tanks
      containing shrimp pond waters, and the tanks were rolled for 48 h. Besides water 
      quality (inorganic nutrients and physical parameters), the researchers
      investigated and separated bacterial community compositions (BCC) to free-living 
      (FL) and bio-flocs/particle-attached (PA) bacteria via 16S rRNA amplicon
      sequencing, and measured macro-molecules contents (carbohydrates, lipids and
      proteins) in the bio-flocs. Molasses addition increased bacterial numbers in the 
      bio-flocs to two-fold higher than the FL's. Moreover, potential probiotics such
      as Halomonas, Psychrobacter, Mesonia and Chromohalobacter were detected
      associated to bio-flocs and dominated the BCC. In contrast, bio-flocs without
      molasses showed 4-fold less carbohydrates and harboured elevated potential
      pathogens such as Vibrio and Alteromonas. Results show that molasses (at C/N
      ratio 1:2) increases pH (to 8.2 +/- 0.09 and 8.0 +/- 0.04 after 24 h and 48 h,
      respectively) in pond water, improving beneficial biofloc formation. Molasses
      also increased carbohydrates and proteins in bio-flocs and maintained abundances 
      of beneficial bacteria resulting in low inorganic nutrient concentrations. Thus, 
      molasses is suitable for shrimp farming to improve rearing processes.

AB  - Study on ovarian maturation stages were carried out using external morphological 
      assessment of ovarian colourations and histological assessment of Oocyte
      structure for broodstock selection purpose. Stage 1 to Stage 4 of female shrimps 
      broodstock were sampled from Kuala Muda, Kedah, Malaysia. Four obvious
      colourations of ovary stages were identified which are: yellow (Stage 1), green
      yellowish (Stage 2), light greenish (Stage 3) and dark green (Stage 4) through
      the morphological assessment. The Gonadosomatic Index (GSI) showed significant
      increment as the gonad reach advance stages. Histological assessment of Stage 1
      ovary identified perinucleolar oocyte (PO) with small size oocytes. Stage 2 ovary
      was identified with yolkless oocyte (YO), Stage 3 ovary was identified with late 
      stage of yolky globules and Stage 4 ovary was identified with fully yolky
      globules. From the results achieved, it can be concluded that the ovarian
      colourations and GSI can be applied to identify the ovarian maturation stages,
      meanwhile, the histology assessment is the most precise method to determine the
      ovarian maturation stages in more details and accurate for each of the ovarian
      maturation stages.

TI  - Suite of TMPRSS2 Assays for Screening Drug Repurposing Candidates as Potential
      Treatments of COVID-19.
PG  - 1191-1203
LID - 10.1021/acsinfecdis.2c00172 [doi]
AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is the causative viral pathogen driving the COVID-19 pandemic that
      prompted an immediate global response to the development of vaccines and
      antiviral therapeutics. For antiviral therapeutics, drug repurposing allows for
      rapid movement of the existing clinical candidates and therapies into human
      clinical trials to be tested as COVID-19 therapies. One effective antiviral
      treatment strategy used early in symptom onset is to prevent viral entry.
      SARS-CoV-2 enters ACE2-expressing cells when the receptor-binding domain of the
      spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 followed by cleavage at 
      two cut sites by TMPRSS2. Therefore, a molecule capable of inhibiting the
      protease activity of TMPRSS2 could be a valuable antiviral therapy. Initially, we
      used a fluorogenic high-throughput screening assay for the biochemical screening 
      of 6030 compounds in NCATS annotated libraries. Then, we developed an orthogonal 
      biochemical assay that uses mass spectrometry detection of product formation to
      ensure that hits from the primary screen are not assay artifacts from the
      fluorescent detection of product formation. Finally, we assessed the hits from
      the biochemical screening in a cell-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped particle entry
      assay. Of the six molecules advanced for further studies, two are approved drugs 
      in Japan (camostat and nafamostat), two have entered clinical trials (PCI-27483
      and otamixaban), while the other two molecules are peptidomimetic inhibitors of
      TMPRSS2 taken from the literature that have not advanced into clinical trials
      (compounds 92 and 114). This work demonstrates a suite of assays for the
      discovery and development of new inhibitors of TMPRSS2.

TI  - Effects of tebufenpyrad on freshwater systems dominated by Neocaridina palmata,
      Physa fontinalis, and Ceratophyllum demersum.

AB  - Tebufenpyrad are widely used for control leaf mites in orchard and may enter
      freshwater systems through runoff, spray drift, and so on. Few papers have
      reported the side effect of the pesticide on population dynamics of aquatic taxa 
      such as shrimps, gastropods, macrophytes, phytoplankton, and bacteria. Here, we
      tested the effect of a single application of tebufenpyrad on Neocaridina palmata,
      Physa fontinalis, Ceratophyllum demersum, Simocephalus vetulus, Dolerocypris
      sinensis, and so on, by indoor systems. The TWA (Time-weighted average)-based
      highest no observed effect concentration (NOEC) and lowest observed effect
      concentration (LOEC) for Neocaridina palmata, which were counted by the wet
      weight, were 0.67 and 2.33 mug/L, respectively, and the dose-related effect
      lasted 21 d. According to our study, chitobiase could be used to quantify the
      effects of the pesticide on shrimp despite the interference from P. fontinalis,
      which was finally corrected by employing of antibodies. The NOEC and LOEC were
      thus determined to be 1.41 and </= 5.64 mug/L, respectively, which were higher
      than the values that was counted by the wet weight. Principal component analysis 
      (PCA) and principal response curve (PRC) investigation showed that the pesticide 
      suppressed population of C. demersum, and phytoplankton, while the Physa
      fontinalis, S. vetulus, and D. sinensis were stimulated by the pesticide.
      Illumina MiSeq was used to determine the alteration in bacterial community within
      the systems. The results of PRC and PCA analyses showed that tebufenpyrad induced
      flora of nitrate reducing, nitrate denitrifying, thiosulfate oxidation,
      ureolysis, and methanol oxidation, while it suppressed flora of cellulolysis.
      Tebufenpyrad was found to have a negative effect on water quality indicators such
      as pH, DO, NO3(-), NO2(-), and SO4(2-), and a positive effect on PO4(3-), NH4(+),
      and EC. This suggested that the tebufenpyrad led to water quality deterioration.

TI  - Aquaculture Molecular Breeding Platform (AMBP): a comprehensive web server for
      genotype imputation and genetic analysis in aquaculture.

LID - 10.1093/nar/gkac424 [doi]
AB  - It is of vital importance to understand the population structure, dissect the
      genetic bases of performance traits, and make proper strategies for selection in 
      breeding programs. However, there is no single webserver covering the specific
      needs in aquaculture. We present Aquaculture Molecular Breeding Platform (AMBP), 
      the first web server for genetic data analysis in aquatic species of farming
      interest. AMBP integrates the haplotype reference panels of 18 aquaculture
      species, which greatly improves the accuracy of genotype imputation. It also
      supports multiple tools to infer genetic structures, dissect the genetic
      architecture of performance traits, estimate breeding values, and predict optimum
      contribution. All the tools are coherently linked in a web-interface for users to
      generate interpretable results and evaluate statistical appropriateness. The
      webserver supports standard VCF and PLINK (PED, MAP) files, and implements
      automated pipelines for format transformation and visualization to simplify the
      process of analysis. As a demonstration, we applied the webserver to Pacific
      white shrimp and Atlantic salmon datasets. In summary, AMBP constitutes
      comprehensive resources and analytical tools for exploring genetic data and
      guiding practical breeding programs. AMBP is available at http://mgb.qnlm.ac.

TI  - Characterization of Isolated Aerobic Denitrifying Bacteria and Their Potential
      Use in the Treatment of Nitrogen-Polluted Aquaculture Water.
PG  - 209
LID - 10.1007/s00284-022-02898-2 [doi]
AB  - Ammonia and nitrite treatments are the critical steps that must be done to ensure
      the healthy growth of aquatic animals. The nitrification process is often used
      for nitrogen removal purposes due to its efficiency and environmentally friendly 
      properties. However, the varied growth rate between ammonia and nitrite-oxidizing
      bacteria can cause nitrite accumulation, leading to the massive mortality of
      aquatic animals at high concentrations. Therefore, this study aimed to integrate 
      the fast-growing heterotrophic nitrite-reducing bacteria with nitrifying bacteria
      to achieve a quicker nitrite removal activity. The two denitrifying Bacillus sp. 
      ST20 and Bacillus sp. ST26 were screened from shrimp ponds in Bac Lieu province, 
      Vietnam. Obtained results showed that under anoxic conditions, the nitrite
      removal efficiency of these two strains reached 68.5-82% at nitrite initial
      concentration of 20 mgN-NO2/L after 72 h. Higher efficiency of over 95% was
      gained under oxic conditions. Hence, it enabled the use of denitrifying and
      nitrifying bacteria-co-immobilized carriers for ammonia oxidation and nitrite
      reduction simultaneously in a single-aerated bioreactor. A total of over 96%
      nitrogen content was removed during the bioreactor operation, despite the
      increase of inputting nitrogen concentration from 40 to 200 mgN/L. Moreover, the 
      suitable conditions for bacterial growth and nitrite conversion activity of the
      ST20 and ST26 were detected as 15 per thousand salinity and 35 degrees C. The
      isolates also utilized various C-sources for growth, hence widening their
      applicability. The present study suggested that the isolated aerobic denitrifying
      bacteria are potentially used for the complete removal of nitrogen compounds from
      aquaculture wastewater.

TI  - Usefulness of the pancreas as a prime target for histopathological diagnosis of
      Tilapia parvovirus (TiPV) infection in Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus.
LID - 10.1111/jfd.13663 [doi]
AB  - Tilapia parvovirus (TiPV) is an emerging virus reportedly associated with disease
      and mortality in farmed tilapia. Although previous descriptions of
      histopathological changes are available, the lesions reported in these are not
      pathognomonic. Here, we report Cowdry type A inclusion bodies (CAIB) in the
      pancreas as a diagnostic histopathological feature found in adult Nile tilapia
      naturally infected with TiPV. This type of inclusion body has been well-known as 
      a histopathological landmark for the diagnosis of other parvoviral infections in 
      shrimp and terrestrial species. Interestingly, this lesion could be exclusively
      observed in pancreatic acinar cells, both in the hepatopancreas and pancreatic
      tissue along the intestine. In situ hybridization (ISH) using a TiPV-specific
      probe revealed the intranuclear presence of TiPV DNA in multiple tissues,
      including the liver, pancreas, kidney, spleen, gills and the membrane of oocytes 
      in the ovary. These findings suggest that although TiPV can replicate in several 
      tissue types, CAIB manifest exclusively in pancreatic tissues. In addition to
      TiPV, most diseased fish were co-infected with Streptococcus agalactiae, and
      presented with multifocal granulomas secondary to this bacterial infection.
      Partial genome amplification of TiPV was successful and revealed high nucleotide 
      identity (>99%) to previously reported isolates. In summary, this study
      highlights the usefulness of pancreatic tissue as a prime target for
      histopathological diagnosis of TiPV in diseased Nile tilapia. This pattern may be
      critical when determining the presence of TiPV infection in new geographic areas,
      where ancillary testing may not be available. TiPV pathogenesis in this landmark 
      organ warrants further investigation.

AB  - Despite their evolutionary, molecular biology and biotechnological significance, 
      relatively fewer numbers of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) filamentous phages
      belonging to the family Inoviridae have been discovered and characterized to
      date. The present study focused on genome sequencing and characterization of an
      ssDNA Vibrio parahaemolyticus phage V5 previously isolated from an inland saline 
      shrimp culture farm. The complete circular genome of phage V5 consisted of 6658
      bp with GC content of 43.7%. During BLASTn analysis, only 36% of phage V5 genome 
      matched with other Vibrio phage genomes in the NCBI database with a sequence
      identity value of 79%. During the phylogenetic analysis, phage V5 formed a
      separate branch in the minor clade. These features indicate the novel nature of
      the phage V5 genome. Among 10 predicted open reading frames (ORFs) in the phage
      V5 genome, 6 encoded for the proteins of known biological functions, whereas the 
      rest were classified as hypotheticals. Proteins involved in replication and
      structural assembly were encoded by the phage genome. However, the absence of
      genes encoding for DNA/RNA polymerases and tRNAs signified that phage V5 is
      dependent on the host`s molecular machinery for its propagation. As per our
      knowledge, this is the first study describing the novel genome sequence of an
      ssDNA V. parahaemolyticus phage from the inland saline environment.

AB  - Maintaining eubiosis of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota is essential for
      animal health. White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is the most lethal viral pathogen
      because it causes extremely high mortality in shrimp farming. However, it remains
      poorly understood how WSSV infection affects the microbiota in different regions 
      of the GI tract of shrimp. In the present study, we established an experimental
      model of kuruma shrimp (Marsupenaeus japonicus) infection with WSSV and then
      investigated the effects of WSSV infection on the microbiota in the cardiac
      stomach, pyloric stomach, and intestines using metataxonomics. We identified 34
      phyla and 576 genera of bacteria collectively. At the phylum level,
      Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were the most abundant in all the three GI
      segments. The WSSV infection decreased microbial diversity to a different extent 
      in the stomachs and in a time-dependent manner. The infection with WSSV affected 
      the microbiota composition in the two stomachs, but not the intestines.
      Firmicutes increased significantly, while Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and
      Cyanobacteria decreased in the two stomachs of the WSSV-infected shrimp. At the
      genus level, Trichococcus and Vibrio increased, but Bradyrhizobium and Roseburia 
      decreased in the cardiac stomach of the WSSV-infected shrimp. Trichococcus and
      Photobacterium increased in the pyloric stomach. Although Vibrio showed a slight 
      downward trend, Aliivibrio (formerly Vibrio) increased in the pyloric stomach.
      Thiothrix, Fusibacter, and Shewanella decreased in the pyloric stomach, but no
      significant differences in these genera were detected in the cardiac stomach.
      Analysis of the predicted functions of the GI microbiota indicated that the WSSV 
      infection resulted in losses of some microbiota functions. The new information
      from this study may help better understand the bacteria-virus interaction in the 
      GI tract of shrimp and other crustacean species, and inform pathogen
      prevention/control and sustainable aquaculture production.

TI  - Establishment and application of a TaqMan probe-based qPCR for the detection of
      Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei in shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei.
PG  - 2263-2274
LID - 10.1007/s00436-022-07559-8 [doi]
AB  - Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP) is a common parasite that invades the
      epithelial cytoplasm in the hepatopancreas of shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei and
      results in slow growth of the host shrimps to cause significant economic loss in 
      shrimp aquaculture. In this study, a TaqMan probe-based qPCR for quantitative
      detection of EHP was established. A pair of specific primers and a TaqMan probe
      were designed based on the sequence of cysteine desulfurase gene (NFS1) of EHP.
      The standard curve between cycle threshold (Ct) and the logarithmic starting
      quantity (SQ) of the template was determined as Ct = - 3.231 lg (SQ) + 40.638,
      with a correlation coefficient (R(2)) of 0.998 and an amplification efficiency of
      103.9%. The lower limit of quantification was 1.67 x 10(1) copies/muL for this
      TaqMan probe-based qPCR and 1.67 x 10(3) copies/muL for the conventional PCR. The
      TaqMan probe-based qPCR established in the research was 100 times more sensitive 
      than the conventional PCR method. In addition, the results of clinical sample
      detection indicated that the present technique was efficient in detecting EHP in 
      the hepatopancreas, feces, water, and pond bottom mud samples. Therefore, the
      established TaqMan probe-based qPCR is a suitable technique for detecting EHP in 
      both shrimp and aquatic environment samples.

AB  - Filamentous microalga Klebsormidium sp. has huge potential to become a natural
      and healthy additive in aquatic feed since it contains various bioactive
      nutrients, such as linoleic acid (LA), carotenoids, and chlorophylls. Therefore, 
      an eight-week feeding experiment was performed to evaluate the effects of dietary
      Klebsormidium sp. on the growth performance, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
      status, metabolism, and mid-intestine morphology of Litopenaeus vannamei. Two
      isonitrogenous and isolipid diets supplemented with and without 5% Klebsormidium 
      sp. were prepared. Results showed that L. vannamei fed with Klebsormidium sp. had
      better growth performance and feed utilization by optimizing mid-intestine
      morphology and improving the carbohydrate metabolism. In addition, Klebsormidium 
      sp. also enhanced the antioxidant capacity of L. vannamei by downregulating
      antioxidant parameters (hepatopancreas T-SOD, hepatopancreas GSH-PX, hemolymph
      T-SOD, hemolymph MDA) and RNA expression levels of antioxidant genes (gsh-px and 
      cat). Furthermore, the supplementations of dietary Klebsormidium sp.
      significantly improved hepatopancreas health by downregulating RNA expression
      levels of pro-inflammatory related genes (relish and rho). Therefore, a dose of
      5% Klebsormidium sp. is recommended for the daily diet of L. vannamei to improve 
      the growth performance, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory status, metabolism, and
      mid-intestine morphology of shrimp.

AB  - The many ecological niches present in an organism harbor distinct microorganisms 
      called microbiota. Different factors can influence the establishment of these
      commensal microbial communities. In a previous article, we have concluded that
      some bacterial lineages associated with the early larval stages of the Pacific
      blue shrimp Litopenaeus stylirostris could be acquired from the breeders via a
      potential vertical transmission. The present study was conducted in order to
      investigate this hypothesis. Using HiSeq sequencing of the V4 region of 16S rRNA 
      gene, we analyzed the active microbiota associated with the eggs and the nauplii 
      of L. stylirsotris as well as with the reproductive organs of their breeders.
      Microbial communities associated with the rearing water were also considered to
      discriminate environmental microbial lineages. Using these analyses, we highlight
      a set of core bacterial families present in all samples and composed of members
      of Colwelliaceae, Alteromonadaceae, Pseudoalteromonadaceae, Saccharospirillaceae,
      Oceanospirillaceae, Vibrionaceae, Burkholderiaceae, Rhodobacteraceae,
      Flavobacteraceae, and Corynebacteriaceae; showing the importance of the
      environment in the establishment of the larval microbiota. We also present
      specific bacteria affiliated to the Arcobacteraceae, Rhodobacteraceae,
      Comamonadaceae, and Colwelliaceae families, which were only found in the breeders
      and their offspring strengthening the hypothesis of a potential vertical
      transmission shaping the active microbiota of the eggs and the nauplii of L.
      stylirostris.

AB  - It is believed that the virions of a virus infecting a host may share the
      identical viral genome and characteristics. However, the role of genomic
      heterogeneity of the virions of a virus in virus infection has not been
      extensively explored. To address this issue, white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), a 
      DNA virus infecting crustaceans, was characterized in the current study. In WSSV,
      differences in two nucleotides of the viral genome generated two types of WSSV,
      forming a virus population that consisted of Type A WSSV (encoding WSSV
      lncRNA-24) and Type B WSSV (encoding the wsv195 gene) at a ratio of 1:3. The
      virus populations in all virus-infected cells and tissues of different hosts
      exhibited a stable 1:3 structure. WSSV lncRNA-24 in Type A WSSV promoted virus
      infection by binding to shrimp and WSSV miRNAs, while the wsv195 gene in Type B
      WSSV played an essential role in virus infection. Loss of Type A WSSV or Type B
      WSSV in the WSSV population led to a 100-fold decrease in viral copy number in
      shrimp. Simultaneous loss of both types of WSSV prevented virus infection. These 
      results indicated that the virus infection process was completed by two types of 
      WSSV encoding different functional genes, revealing the complementary effects of 
      WSSV population. Therefore, our study highlights the importance of the
      complementarity of virus population components in virus infection.

TI  - Shrimp peptide hydrolysate modulates the immune response in cyclophosphamide
      immunosuppressed mice model.
PG  - e14251
LID - 10.1111/jfbc.14251 [doi]
AB  - Bioactive peptides are naturally found in various foods and were shown to have
      various distinct physiological as well as medicinal benefits. In this study
      shrimp peptide hydrolysate (SPH) was prepared to investigate its immunomodulatory
      effect against cyclophosphamide (CTX) induced immunosuppressed mice. The SPH
      effect was also analyzed on murine macrophage (RAW264.7 cells). The findings show
      that SPH stimulates macrophages to form multiple pseudopodia, has no cytotoxic
      effect, and increases phagocytic activity in RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, the
      immunosuppressed in-vivo model illustrates the improvement in various aspects,
      that is body weight, escalation in immune organ index, and ameliorates
      histopathological transformation of thymus along with the spleen. SPH enhances
      cell-mediated immunity by facilitating splenocyte proliferation and inhibit
      excessive apoptosis. Moreover, the significant outcome had been observed with the
      upregulation of cytokines interferon-gamma (IFN-Upsilon), interleukin-2 (IL-2)
      level and simultaneously downregulate certain genes include interleukin-4 (IL-4) 
      and interleukin-10 (IL-10). Additionally, SPH expedites cellular immunity by
      enhancing the regulation of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin M (IgM).
      However, these findings support the hypothesis that SPH is an effective
      immunomodulatory agent capable of preventing immune system hypofunction. It is
      necessary to investigate the detailed mechanism to rule out any unforeseen
      effects of SPH in future research. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Chemotherapy
      medications, despite their dominating detrimental effects of damaging
      immunological organs such as the spleen and thymus, extend the treatment process 
      as well as the destruction of the self-immune system. This study found that SPH
      is an effective immunomodulatory agent capable of avoiding immune organ
      hypofunction and improving cell mediate immunity by enhancing macrophage
      activation, phagocytosis, spleenocyte proliferation, suppressing apoptosis, and
      elevating cytokines and antibodies. As a result, SPH can be utilized as a
      nutritional and functional dietary supplement to boost immunological modulation
      in combination with chemotherapy medications in order to lessen their adverse
      effects.

TI  - Interferon-Induced Protein 6-16 (IFI6-16) from Litopenaeus vannamei Regulate
      Antiviral Immunity via Apoptosis-Related Genes.
LID - 1062 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14051062 [doi]
AB  - A growing number of evidence shows that some invertebrates possess an antiviral
      immunity parallel to the interferon (IFN) system of higher vertebrates. For
      example, the IRF (interferon regulatory factor)-Vago-JAK/STAT regulatory axis in 
      an arthropod, shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei (whiteleg shrimp) is functionally
      similar to the IRF-IFN-JAK/STAT axis of mammals. IFNs perform their cellular
      immunity by regulating the expression of target genes collectively referred to as
      IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). However, the function of invertebrate ISGs in immune
      responses is almost completely unclear. In this study, a potential ISG gene
      homologous to the interferon-induced protein 6-16 (IFI6-16) was cloned and
      identified from L. vannamei, designated as LvIFI6-16. LvIFI6-16 contained a
      putative signal peptide in the N-terminal, and a classic IFI6-16-superfamily
      domain in the C-terminal that showed high conservation to other homologs in
      various species. The mRNA levels of LvIFI6-16 were significantly upregulated
      after the stimulation of poly (I:C) and challenges of white spot syndrome virus
      (WSSV). Moreover, silencing of LvIFI6-16 caused a higher mortality rate and
      heightened virus loads, suggesting that LvIFI6-16 could play a crucial role in
      defense against WSSV. Interestingly, we found that the transcription levels of
      several caspases were regulated by LvIFI6-16; meanwhile, the transcription level 
      of LvIFI6-16 self was regulated by the JAK/STAT cascade, suggesting there could
      be a JAK/STAT-IFI6-16-caspase regulatory axis in shrimp. Taken together, we
      identified a crustacean IFI6-16 gene (LvIFI6-16) for the first time, and provided
      evidence that the IFI6-16 participated in antiviral immunity in shrimp.

TI  - New Isolated Shrimp (Litopenaeus setiferus) Chitosan-Based Films Loaded with Fly 
      Ash for Antibacterial Evaluation.
LID - 2099 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/polym14102099 [doi]
AB  - New three fabricated chitosan (CS) loaded with fly ash (FA) films were developed 
      in this study. The shell waste of white shrimp was used as a precursor for the
      isolation of chitin and converted into chitosan by carrying out a deacetylation
      process. The formation of chitosan was conducted by various preparation steps
      deproteinization, demineralization, and deacetylation. The degree of
      deacetylation was found to be 95.2%. The obtained chitosan was used to prepare
      three different chitosan loaded-fly ash films. The prepared films contained
      various fly ash: chitosan ratios (2:1, FA-CSF1), (1:1, FA-CSF2), and (1:2,
      FA-CSF3). The obtained films were characterized using FTIR, XRD, and SEM. The
      micrograph images of the formed films showed spherical particles with an average 
      size of 10 microm. The surface area, adsorption-desorption properties, thermal
      stability, and water/fat binding features of the fabricated chitosan films were
      studied. The results revealed that the prepared films displayed typical BET
      graphs with surface areas ranging from 2.436 m(2) g(-1) to 8.490 m(2) g(-1). The 
      fabricated FA-CSF films also showed high thermal stability at temperatures up to 
      284.9 degrees C and excellent water/fat binding capacities. The antibacterial
      potential of the designed films was screened against E. coli (Gram-negative) and 
      B. cereus (Gram-positive) bacterial strains. The tested solution of CS (1%)
      exhibited inhibition zones for E. coli and B. cereus as 18.51 mm and 14.81 mm,
      respectively, while in FA solution (1%), the inhibition zones were found to be
      10.16 mm, and 13.57 mm, respectively. The results encourage and open up the new
      and promising areas of research for applying chitosan extracted from waste
      materials in biological applications.

TI  - Calcium-Rich Biochar Stimulates Salt Resistance in Pearl Millet (Pennisetum
      glaucum L.) Plants by Improving Soil Quality and Enhancing the Antioxidant
      Defense.
LID - 1301 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/plants11101301 [doi]
AB  - Shrimp waste is rich in organic compounds and essential plant nutrients, e.g.,
      calcium (Ca), and converting these wastes to organic fertilizer is important for 
      environmental preservation and to achieve sustainable agricultural management. In
      the current study, Ca-rich biochar was prepared from shrimp wastes (SWB) by
      pyrolysis at 300 degrees C. We hypothesized that the Ca-rich biochar will help in
      solving the problem of plant growth in saline soil by reducing sodium (Na) uptake
      and mitigating oxidative stress. The current study aimed to investigate the
      effect of SWB on the quality of saline sandy soil and the mechanism of salt
      resistance in pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.). Pearl millet plants were
      planted in saline sandy soil (10 dS m(-1)) in wooden boxes (1.3 x 0.8 m size and 
      0.4 m height), and 5 doses (0, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5% (w/w)) of SWB were added. 
      SWB application increased the soil quality and nutrient uptake by pearl millet
      plants. The highest rate of SWB increased the soil microbial biomass carbon and
      the activity of dehydrogenase enzyme by 43 and 47% compared to the control soil. 
      SWB application reduced the uptake of sodium (Na(+)) and chloride (Cl(-)) and
      increased the K/Na ratio in the leaf tissues. SWB addition significantly
      increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes, e.g., ascorbate peroxidase (APX), 
      polyphenol oxidase (PPO), and pyrogallol peroxidases (PPX). The application of
      2.5% SWB to the saline soil increased the soluble carbohydrates and proline in
      plant leaves by 75 and 60%, respectively, and reduced the malondialdehyde (MDA)
      by 32% compared to the control. SWB enhanced the antioxidant defense and
      mitigated oxidative stress by improving the synthesis of osmoprotectants, e.g.,
      soluble carbohydrates and proline. Sandy saline soils in arid and semiarid areas 
      suffer greatly from low organic matter contents, which reduces the soil quality
      and increases the risk of salt during plant growth. The high organic matter and
      calcium content (30%) in the shrimp waste-derived biochar improved the quality of
      the saline sandy soil, reduced the uptake of toxic salts, and increased the
      quality of the forage material. The addition of recycled shrimp waste to saline
      low-fertility soils improves soil productivity and is safe for soil health.

TI  - Effect of Input C/N Ratio on Bacterial Community of Water Biofloc and Shrimp Gut 
      in a Commercial Zero-Exchange System with Intensive Production of Penaeus
      vannamei.
LID - 1060 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10051060 [doi]
AB  - Although increasing attention has been attracted to the study and application of 
      biofloc technology (BFT) in aquaculture, few details have been reported about the
      bacterial community of biofloc and its manipulation strategy for commercial
      shrimp production. An 8-week trial was conducted to investigate the effects of
      three input C/N ratios (8:1, 12:1 and 16:1) on the bacterial community of water
      biofloc and shrimp gut in a commercial BFT tank system with intensive aquaculture
      of P. vannamei. Each C/N ratio group had three randomly assigned replicate tanks 
      (culture water volume of 30 m(3)), and each tank was stocked with juvenile shrimp
      at a density of 300 shrimp m(-3). The tank systems were operated with zero-water 
      exchange, pH maintenance and biofloc control. During the trial, the microbial
      biomass and bacterial density of water biofloc showed similar variation trends,
      with no significant difference under respective biofloc control measures for the 
      three C/N ratio groups. Significant changes were found in the alpha diversity,
      composition and relative abundance of bacterial communities across the stages of 
      the trial, and they showed differences in water biofloc and shrimp gut among the 
      three C/N ratio groups. Meanwhile, high similarity could be found in the
      composition of the bacterial community between water biofloc and shrimp gut.
      Additionally, nitrogen dynamics in culture water showed some differences while
      shrimp performance showed no significant difference among the three C/N ratio
      groups. Together, these results confirm that the manipulation of input C/N ratio 
      could affect the bacterial community of both water biofloc and shrimp gut in the 
      environment of a commercial BFT system with intensive production of P. vannamei. 
      Moreover, there should be different operations for the nitrogen dynamics and
      biofloc management during shrimp production process under different C/N ratios.

TI  - Microcapsules of Shrimp Oil Using Kidney Bean Protein Isolate and
      kappa-Carrageenan as Wall Materials with the Aid of Ultrasonication or
      High-Pressure Microfluidization: Characteristics and Oxidative Stability.
LID - 1431 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/foods11101431 [doi]
AB  - Emulsions containing shrimp oil (SO) at varying amounts were prepared in the
      presence of red kidney bean protein isolate (KBPI) and kappa-carrageenan (KC) at 
      a ratio of 1:0.1 (w/w). The emulsions were subjected to ultrasonication and
      high-pressure microfluidization to assist the encapsulation process. For each
      sample, ultrasonication was carried out for 15 min in continuous mode at 80%
      amplitude, whereas high-pressure microfluidization was operated at 7000 psi for
      10 min. Ultrasonicated and microfluidized emulsions were finally spray-dried to
      prepare KBPI-KC-SO microcapsules. Moderate to high encapsulation efficiency (EE) 
      ranging from 43.99 to 89.25% of SO in KPBI-KC-SO microcapsules was obtained and
      the microcapsules had good flowability. Particle size, PDI and zeta potential of 
      KBPI-KC-SO microcapsules were 2.58-6.41 microm, 0.32-0.40 and -35.95--58.77 mV,
      respectively. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images visually demonstrated
      that the wall material/SO ratio and the emulsification method (ultrasonication vs
      microfluidization) had an impact on the size, shape and surface of the KBPI-KC-SO
      microcapsules. Encapsulation of SO in microcapsules was validated empirically
      using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis. Encapsulation of SO in KBPI-KC 
      microcapsules imparted superior protection against oxidative deterioration of SO 
      as witnessed by the higher retention of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and
      astaxanthin when compared to unencapsulated SO during extended storage at room
      temperature.

TI  - The Antioxidant Effect of Natural Antimicrobials in Shrimp Primary Intestinal
      Cells Infected with Nematopsis messor.
LID - 974 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antiox11050974 [doi]
AB  - Nematopsis messor infections severely impact on shrimp's health with devastating 
      economic consequences on shrimp farming. In a shrimp primary intestinal cells
      (SGP) model of infection, a sub-inhibitory concentration (0.5%) of natural
      antimicrobials (Aq) was able to reduce the ability of N. messor to infect (p &lt;
      0.0001). To prevent N. messor infection of SGP cells, Aq inhibits host actin
      polymerization and restores tight junction integrity (TEER) and the expression of
      Zo-1 and occluding. The oxidative burst, caused by N. messor infection, is
      attenuated by Aq through the inhibition of NADPH-produced H2O2. Simultaneous to
      the reduction in H2O2 released, the activity of catalase (CAT) and superoxide
      dismutase (SOD) were also significantly increase (p &lt; 0.0001). The
      antimicrobial mixture inactivates the ERK signal transduction pathway by tyrosine
      dephosphorylation and reduces the expression of DCR2, ALF-A, and ALF-C
      antimicrobial peptides. The observed in vitro results were also translated in
      vivo, whereby the use of a shrimp challenge test, we show that in N. messor
      infected shrimp the mortality rate was 68% compared to the Aq-treated group where
      the mortality rate was maintained at 14%. The significant increase in CAT and SOD
      activity in treated and infected shrimp suggested an in vivo antioxidant role for
      Aq. In conclusion, our study shows that Aq can efficiently reduce N. messor
      colonization of shrimp's intestinal cells in vitro and in vivo and the oxidative 
      induced cellular damage, repairs epithelial integrity, and enhances gut immunity.

AB  - The iron flocculation method, which comprises the Fe-virus flocculate
      formation-filtration-resuspension steps, is extensively used to concentrate and
      precipitate viruses distributed in water. To apply this method to concentrate
      white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) in seawater, viral genomic and infective
      recovery yields were compared between polyethylene sulfone (PES) and
      polycarbonate (PC) membrane filters and two types of resuspension buffers
      (oxalate and ascorbate). Viral genome quantitation was determined above a 95 %
      limit of detection (11.48 viral DNA copies/muL) using quantitative real-time PCR.
      From WSSV-spiked seawater (10(0)-10(6) viral DNA copies/mL), the viral genomic
      recovery yields of the PES-Oxalate, PC-Oxalate, PES-Ascorbate, and PC-Ascorbate
      conditions were 78.67 % +/- 12.90 %, 84.53 % +/- 24.30 %, 85.59 % +/- 16.98 %,
      and 93.74 % +/- 7.44 %, respectively. The detectable Fe-virus flocculates
      collected by the PC membrane were approximately 10(1) WSSV DNA copies/mL of
      seawater, a value more than 10-fold higher than that compared to the PES membrane
      filter (10(2) WSSV DNA copies/mL), regardless of the resuspension buffer types.
      WSSV resuspended with oxalate buffer caused mass mortality among whiteleg shrimp 
      (Litopenaeus vannamei), inducing the expression of the virus envelope protein,
      VP28, similar to that of a native virus, suggesting stable viral activity during 
      the resuspension process. Based on the PES-Ascorbate, WSSV particles could be
      successfully concentrated in seawater from shrimp farms with white spot disease
      outbreaks (approximately 10(2) WSSV DNA copies/mL). Collectively, these findings 
      indicate that the simple and efficient method of iron flocculation is sufficient 
      to concentrate WSSV in seawater and could be used as a non-invasive approach and 
      one of the reasonable diagnostic processes for white spot disease surveillance.

TI  - Revealing the Structural Coloration of Self-Assembled Chitin Nanocrystal Films.
PG  - e2203300
LID - 10.1002/adma.202203300 [doi]
AB  - The structural coloration of arthropods often arises from helicoidal structures
      made primarily of chitin. Although it is possible to achieve analogous helicoidal
      architectures by exploiting the self-assembly of chitin nanocrystals (ChNCs), to 
      date no evidence of structural coloration has been reported from such structures.
      Previous studies are identified to have been constrained by both the experimental
      inability to access sub-micrometer helicoidal pitches and the intrinsically low
      birefringence of crystalline chitin. To expand the range of accessible pitches,
      here, ChNCs are isolated from two phylogenetically distinct sources of
      alpha-chitin, namely fungi and shrimp, while to increase the birefringence, an in
      situ alkaline treatment is performed, increasing the intensity of the reflected
      color by nearly two orders of magnitude. By combining this treatment with precise
      control over ChNC suspension formulation, structurally colored chitin-based films
      are demonstrated with reflection tunable from blue to near infrared.

TI  - Dietary Factors and Incidence of Hydatidiform Mole: An Ecological Study.
PG  - 1-8

AB  - The current ecological study aims to explore the association between dietary
      factors and hydatidiform mole (HM) incidence in Japan and China. HM incidence in 
      Japan gradually declined from 1970s to 1990s, while the dietary structure also
      changed during the same period, mainly characterized by a decrease in the
      consumption of cereals and an increase in the consumption of meat, eggs, and
      dairy products. In China, HM incidence varied by regions, and it positively
      correlated with the per capita intake of rice, fish and shrimp, and animal fat,
      as well as the proportion of GDP of primary industry; and negatively correlated
      with the per capita intake of wheat flour, starch and sugar, protein, and iron,
      and the proportion of protein in the caloric nutrients and the proportion of
      nonagricultural population. In partial analysis, the correlations of HM incidence
      with rice, fish and shrimp, iron, and the proportion of protein in caloric
      nutrients remained significant. Meanwhile, alcoholic beverage consumption and the
      proportion of empty calories in caloric food were also found to be positively
      correlated with HM incidence, while phosphorus consumption was negatively
      correlated. Our results suggested that HM incidence could be influenced by
      dietary factors.

TI  - Novel alpha-Amylase Inhibitor Hemi-Pyocyanin Produced by Microbial Conversion of 
      Chitinous Discards.
LID - 283 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/md20050283 [doi]
AB  - alpha-Amylase inhibitors (aAIs) have been applied for the efficient management of
      type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to search for potential aAIs produced 
      by microbial fermentation. Among various bacterial strains, Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa TUN03 was found to be a potential aAI-producing strain, and shrimp
      heads powder (SHP) was screened as the most suitable C/N source for fermentation.
      P. aeruginosa TUN03 exhibited the highest aAIs productivity (3100 U/mL) in the
      medium containing 1.5% SHP with an initial pH of 7-7.5, and fermentation was
      performed at 27.5 degrees C for two days. Further, aAI compounds were
      investigated for scaled-up production in a 14 L-bioreactor system. The results
      revealed a high yield (4200 U/mL) in a much shorter fermentation time (12 h)
      compared to fermentation in flasks. Bioactivity-guided purification resulted in
      the isolation of one major target compound, identified as hemi-pyocyanin (HPC)
      via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance. Its
      purity was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. HPC demonstrated
      potent alpha-amylase inhibitory activity comparable to that of acarbose, a
      commercial antidiabetic drug. Notably, HPC was determined as a new aAI. The
      docking study indicated that HPC inhibits alpha-amylase by binding to amino acid 
      Arg421 at the biding site on enzyme alpha-amylase with good binding energy (-9.3 
      kcal/mol) and creating two linkages of H-acceptors.

TI  - Studies on temperature impact (sudden and gradual) of the white-leg shrimp
      Litopenaeus vannamei.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-20963-y [doi]
AB  - In the present study, the effect of temperature shock (sudden and gradual) by
      increasing water temperature from 28 degrees C to 40 degrees C on survival,
      behavioral responses and immunological changes in Litopenaeus vannamei (L.
      vannamei) was studied. In sudden temperature shock, experimental groups were
      maintained at different temperature ranges such as 28 degrees C- 31 degrees C; 28
      degrees C-34 degrees C; 28 degrees C-37 degrees C and 28 degrees C-40 degrees C
      along with 28 degrees C as control. For gradual temperature shock experiments,
      the initial water temperature was maintained at 28 degrees C for 24 h in control 
      and then increased to 1 degrees C for every 24 h until reaching 40 degrees C. On 
      reaching the final temperature of 40 degrees C, it was kept stable for 120 h.
      Results indicated that the increasing water temperature (sudden shock) affected
      survival, behavioral responses and immunological parameter. No shrimp survived at
      40 degrees C treatment (sudden), whereas in the gradual temperature shock
      experiment 20% of animals survived at 40 degrees C. The increasing water
      temperature had no effects on behavioral responses up to 37 degrees C (gradual), 
      but at 40 degrees C the observation of muscle cramps, low swimming rate, no
      feeding, muscle and hepatopancreas color turned whitish. Overall, the results
      suggest that L. vannamei can tolerate water temperature up to 34 degrees C under 
      sudden shock and 37 degrees C under gradual shock conditions. This study reveals 
      that shrimp L. vannamei can self-regulate to a certain extent of temperature
      variation in the environment.

AB  - Clostridium butyricum (CB) is a gram-positive bacterium that secretes short-chain
      fatty acids such as butyric acid and so on. An 8-week feeding trial was conducted
      to investigate the effects of CB on the growth performance, antioxidant capacity,

      1.2 x 10(9) CFU/kg), 0.48% (C3, 4.8 x 10(9) CFU/kg) and 1.92% (C4, 1.92 x 10(10) 
      CFU/kg) CB were supplemented on the negative control group (NC). After the
      feeding trial, the remaining shrimp in each treatment group were subjected to a
      challenge experiment with Vibrio parahaemolyticus. The results indicated that
      weight gain rate (WGR), specific growth rate (SGR) in C4 group were significantly
      lower than those in PC and C2 groups (P < 0.05); the feed conversion ratio (FCR) 
      was significantly higher than that of PC and C2 groups (P < 0.05). There was no
      significant difference in survival rate (SR) among all groups (P > 0.05).
      Compared to the PC and NC groups, the total superoxide capacity, superoxide
      dismutase and lysozyme were significantly higher in the C4 group (P < 0.05); the 
      glutathione peroxidase, acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase were
      significantly higher in the C3 group (P < 0.05); and the malondialdehyde was
      significantly lower in the C4 group (P < 0.05). The relative mRNA expressions of 
      Toll receptor (TLR), innate immune deficiency gene (IMD), penaiedin3a (Pen3) were
      significantly down-regulated in the NC group than those in the PC group (P <
      0.05). In addition, the relative mRNA expressions of TLR, IMD and Pen3 were
      significantly up-regulated in all groups supplemented with CB than those in the
      NC group (P < 0.05). Moreover, the cumulative mortality rate in the NC group was 
      not significantly different from the PC group (P > 0.05) and was significantly
      higher than those in the C3 and C4 groups (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the CB
      supplementation on the basis of CPC replacement of 30% fishmeal protein enhanced 
      significantly the antioxidant capacity, immunity and disease resistance of shrimp
      and improved its growth performance. Therefore, considering the factors of the
      growth, immunity and disease resistance, the CB supplementation of 0.12%-0.48%
      (1.2 x 10(9) CFU/kg-4.8 x 10(9) CFU/kg) was recommended in the diet of L.
      vannamei based on the results of this experiment.

TI  - Microbiome of Penaeus vannamei Larvae and Potential Biomarkers Associated With
      High and Low Survival in Shrimp Hatchery Tanks Affected by Acute Hepatopancreatic
      Necrosis Disease.
PG  - 838640
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.838640 [doi]
AB  - Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) is an emerging bacterial disease 
      of cultured shrimp caused mainly by Vibrio parahaemolyticus, which harbors the
      lethal PirAB toxin genes. Although Penaeus vannamei (P. vannamei) postlarvae are 
      susceptible to AHPND, the changes in the bacterial communities through the larval
      stages affected by the disease are unknown. We characterized, through
      high-throughput sequencing, the microbiome of P. vannamei larvae infected with
      AHPND-causing bacteria through the larval stages and compared the microbiome of
      larvae collected from high- and low-survival tanks. A total of 64 tanks from a
      commercial hatchery were sampled at mysis 3, postlarvae 4, postlarvae 7, and
      postlarvae 10 stages. PirAB toxin genes were detected by PCR and confirmed by
      histopathology analysis in 58 tanks. Seven from the 58 AHPND-positive tanks
      exhibited a survival rate higher than 60% at harvest, despite the AHPND
      affectation, being selected for further analysis, whereas 51 tanks exhibited
      survival rates lower than 60%. A random sample of 7 out of these 51
      AHPND-positive tanks was also selected. Samples collected from the selected tanks
      were processed for the microbiome analysis. The V3-V4 hypervariable regions of
      the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene of the samples collected from both the groups
      were sequenced. The Shannon diversity index was significantly lower at the
      low-survival tanks. The microbiomes were significantly different between high-
      and low-survival tanks at M3, PL4, PL7, but not at PL10. Differential abundance
      analysis determined that biomarkers associated with high and low survival in
      shrimp hatchery tanks affected with AHPND. The genera Bacillus, Vibrio, Yangia,
      Roseobacter, Tenacibaculum, Bdellovibrio, Mameliella, and Cognatishimia, among
      others, were enriched in the high-survival tanks. On the other hand, Gilvibacter,
      Marinibacterium, Spongiimonas, Catenococcus, and Sneathiella, among others, were 
      enriched in the low-survival tanks. The results can be used to develop
      applications to prevent losses in shrimp hatchery tanks affected by AHPND.

AB  - White Spot Disease (WSD), caused by white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), is an acute
      and highly lethal viral disease of shrimp. Currently, there are no commercially
      available drugs to control WSD. It is urgent and necessary to find anti-WSSV
      drugs. Natural compounds are an important source of antiviral drug discovery. In 
      this study, the anti-WSSV activity of natural compound geniposide (GP) was
      investigated in crayfish Procambarus clarkii. Results showed that GP had a
      concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on WSSV replication in crayfish at 24
      h, and highest inhibition was more than 98%. In addition, GP significantly
      inhibited the expression of WSSV immediate-early gene ie1, early gene DNApol,
      late gene VP28. The mortality of WSSV-infected crayfish in control groups was
      100%, while it reduced by 70.0% when treated with 50 mg/kg GP. Co-incubation,
      pre-treatment and post-treatment experiments showed that GP could prevent and
      treat WSSV infection in crayfish by significantly inhibiting WSSV multiplication.
      Mechanistically, the syntheses of WSSV structural proteins VP19, VP24, VP26 and
      VP28 were significantly inhibited by GP in S2 cells. Furthermore, GP could also
      suppress WSSV replication by blocking the expression of antiviral
      immunity-related factor STAT to reduce ie1 transcription. Moreover, GP possessed 
      anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activity in crayfish. Overall, GP has the
      potential to be developed as a preventive or therapeutic agent against WSSV
      infection.

TI  - Concurrent infection of a novel genotype of hepatopancreatic parvovirus and
      Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei in Penaeus vannamei in Taiwan.
PG  - 1201-1210
LID - 10.1111/jfd.13655 [doi]
AB  - Hepatopancreatic parvovirus (HPV) and Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP) are
      emerging and reemerging pathogens in shrimps. In the present study, a novel
      genotype of HPV concurrently infected with EHP in Penaeus vannamei in Taiwan
      leading to severe atrophy and damage of hepatopancreas were confirmed by
      histopathology, in situ hybridization, and PCR. The novel genotype of HPV
      exhibited 66%-69.5% sequence identities with all known HPVs and carried unique
      amino acid deletions and insertions in the VP gene. According to phylogenetic
      analysis, the Taiwan HPV isolates were classified as the genotype IV. The present
      study not only provided the histopathological and molecular proof of HPV and EHP 
      co-infection in Taiwan, but also revealed the importance of investigating the
      geographical expansion of novel HPV genotypes.

TI  - Dietary vitamin K3 activates mitophagy, improves antioxidant capacity, immunity
      and affects glucose metabolism in Litopenaeus vannamei.

LID - 10.1039/d2fo00865c [doi]
AB  - An 8-week feeding experiment was conducted to appraise the influence of dietary
      vitamin K3 on the growth performance, antioxidant capacities, immune responses,
      mitophagy and glucose metabolism in Litopenaeus vannamei. Six diets containing
      graded dietary vitamin K3 (0.40(control), 9.97, 20.29, 39.06, 79.81 and 156.02 mg
      kg(-1) of vitamin K3, respectively) levels were formulated. A total of 900 shrimp
      with 0.90 g initial weight were randomly assigned to six diets with three
      replications. Our results revealed that diets supplemented with 9.97-156.02 mg
      kg(-1) vitamin K3 didn't affect the growth performance in L. vannamei. In
      general, compared with the control group, 39.06 mg kg(-1) vitamin K3 group
      significantly increased (P < 0.05) the total antioxidative capacity, and the
      activities of catalase, glutathione, nitric oxide synthase, alkaline phosphatase 
      and acid phosphatase in serum and hepatopancreas. 39.06 mg kg(-1) vitamin K3
      group significantly decreased (P < 0.05) the malondialdehyde in serum and
      hepatopancreas. The mRNA levels of antioxidant and immune related genes were
      increased synchronously (P < 0.05). In addition, 39.06 mg kg(-1) vitamin K3 group
      increased glycogen content and levels of mitophagy (pink1, ampkalpha, parkin,
      lc3, atg13, atg12) genes. Expression levels of glucose transport related gene
      (glut1), glycolysis related genes (hk, pfk), glycogen synthesis related genes
      (gsk-3beta, gys), insulin-like peptides (ILPs)/AKT/PI3K pathway related genes
      (insr, irsl, akt, pi3k, pdpk1) were increased in the hepatopancreas of 39.06 mg
      kg(-1) vitamin K3 group. In conclusion, the present results indicated that
      although dietary supplementing vitamin K3 had no influence on the growth
      performance, 39.06 mg kg(-1) vitamin K3 could activate ampkalpha/pink1/parkin
      mediated mitophagy, improve antioxidant capacity and immune response. Moreover,
      vitamin K3 could trigger ILPs/AKT/PI3K signaling pathways and influence glucose
      metabolism in L. vannamei. This finding would help to advance the field of
      vitamin K3 nutrition and guide the development of future crustacean feeds.

TI  - Impedimetric aptasensor based on porphyrin-based covalent-organic framework for
      determination of diethylstilbestrol.
PG  - 229
LID - 10.1007/s00604-022-05310-9 [doi]
AB  - An impedimetric sensing strategy was developed for sensitively determining
      diethylstilbestrol (DES) based on a platform of porphyrin-containing
      covalent-organic framework (p-COF). The p-COF was synthesized using
      5,10,15,20-tetra (4-aminophenyl) porphyrin (TAPP) and
      1,3,6,8-tetrakis(4-formylphenyl) pyrene (TFPy) as building blocks via
      condensation reaction, for which p-COF was named as TAPP-TFPy-COF. Considering
      the large specific surface area (302.9 m(2) g(-1)), high porosity, rich nitrogen 
      functionality, superior electrochemical activity, and strong bioaffinity toward
      DNA strands, the TAPP-TFPy-COF-based platform exhibited enhanced, non-label, and 
      amplified electrochemical signal, large number of immobilized DES-targeted
      aptamer strands, and fast-response toward the analyte. Electrochemical results
      reveal that the TAPP-TFPy-COF-based aptasensor promoted the sensing performance
      for the detection of DES, resulting in an extremely low limit of detection of
      0.42 fg mL(-1) within a DES concentration ranging from 1 fg mL(-1) to 0.1 pg
      mL(-1), which was substantially lower than those of most reported DES sensors.
      Furthermore, the TAPP-TFPy-COF-based aptasensor possessed outperformed stability,
      high selectivity, ascendant reproducibility, and acceptable applicability in
      diverse environments. The recovery values for DES detection in milk, tap water,
      and frozen shrimp were in the range 91.80-118.50% with low relative standard
      deviation of 0.11-4.26%. This work provides a new sensing electrochemical
      approach based on COF network for DES detection and shows a deep insight into the
      construction of COF-based biosensors, which can be extended to be used for other 
      target compounds.

AB  - One of the most important advancements in harnessing the biological nitrification
      in the field is enrichment solution of nitrifying microbial consortia. In the
      current study, we developed an improved multi-step enrichment to amplify a
      targeted microbial consortium from a sediment sample collected in tropical
      mangrove, Vietnam. The results showed that it took 122 culturing days with five
      unique continuous enrichment steps, the microbial consortium consumed total 5665 
      mgN L(-1). Relative substrate removal rate increased rapidly from 0.114 mgN L(-1)
      h(-1) at the end of the first-step enrichment up to 3.58 mgN L(-1) h(-1) at the
      end of the fifth-step enrichment. High-throughput sequencing revealed that
      Nitrospirae, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the dominant taxa at the
      phylum level while Nitrospira, Marinobacter, Denitromonas and Nitrosomonas were
      the dominant taxa at the genus level in the enriched consortia. A pilot-scale
      experiment for shrimp cultivation of L. vannamei in 84 day-period proved the
      efficiency of Total ammonium nitrogen and nitrite removal in the
      consortium-activated treatment was much higher than the control.

      parahaemolyticus to regulate disease pathogenesis.

AB  - Peritrophins are peritrophic membrane (PM) proteins that can interact with chitin
      fibers via chitin-binding domains. Peritrophins have essential roles in providing
      porosity and strength to the PM that lines the shrimp midgut. Acute
      hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND), caused by strains of V.
      parahaemolyticus, is known to initially colonize the shrimp stomach and
      simultaneously disrupt its structural barriers (e.g., cuticle or epithelial
      tissues) to reach the hepatopancreas. Although stomach and hepatopancreas were
      identified as target tissues involved in AHPND pathogenesis, our results
      indicated that peritrophin in peritrophic membrane has a crucial role in
      determining not only colonization of AHPND-causing bacteria but also their tissue
      distribution. As the interaction between LvPeritrophin (LvPT) and WSSV (white
      spot syndrome virus) is not well understood, we noted that LvPT expression was
      upregulated in shrimp stomach challenged with either WSSV or AHPND. In an in
      vitro pathogen binding assay, there was strong binding of recombinant LvPT WSSV
      and AHPND-causing V. parahaemolyticus, and various bacteria. Furthermore,
      dsRNA-mediated LvPT silencing inhibited WSSV gene expression and viral genome
      replication. However, downregulation of LvPT gene expression increased copies of 
      AHPND-causing bacteria in shrimp digestive tract, and facilitated bacterial
      colonization in stomach. In conclusion, we speculated that LvPT might regulate
      bacterial colonization during AHPND, whereas in WSSV infection, LvPT silencing
      favored the host. Although recombinant LvPT had strong binding with WSSV, the
      precise role of LvPT in WSSV infection needs further investigation. These
      findings increased our understanding of host-pathogen interactions in AHPND and
      WSSV infection that can be applied in shrimp aquaculture for developing effective
      antibacterial and antiviral strategies.

AB  - Shrimps were first subjected to various thermal processing, then tropomyosin (TM)
      was purified and their structure, IgG/IgE-binding ability and detectability were 
      evaluated for elucidating the mechanisms responsible for thermal-induced TM
      immunodetection recovery alterations. According to CD and FT-IR analysis,
      heat-treated shrimp TM had significantly reduced alpha-helix and beta-sheet
      contents with elevated random coil contents, contributing to an increase of
      24.42%-62.22% in IgG/IgE reactivity as compared with raw shrimp TM. The exposure 
      of hydrophobic residues and glycosylation occurred in various heated shrimps TM
      were confirmed by UV, intrinsic/extrinsic fluorescence spectrum and free amino
      group analysis, which caused some epitopes masking or modification, thereby
      inducing considerable TM recovery reduction (48.48%-90.44%). These results
      demonstrated that thermal-treated TMs with higher structural flexibility
      facilitated IgG/IgE recognition, however the lower number of epitopes within the 
      thermal-treated TMs might cause considerable underestimation of recovery. The
      number of antigen binding sites might play a critical role in sandwich
      immunodetection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bioaccumulation of trace metals in the food web demands continuous
      monitoring of seafood safety. Here, the food safety of commercial fish bluespot
      mullet Crenimugil seheli, deep flounder Pseudorhombus elevates, and Jinga shrimp 
      Metapenaeus affinis was assessed from commercial and industrial region of the
      West Bandar Abbas, the North Persian Gulf, for the first time. METHODS: For this 
      purpose, concentrations of trace metals Ni, Zn, Cu, Cr, Cd, and Pb, and their
      health risks were investigated. RESULTS: Results showed the average concentration
      of all trace metals in all species was below concentrations proposed by
      WHO/FAO/USEPA. The finding on risk assessment of three species indicated three
      species are safe for daily consumption. Long-term consumption of three species
      would not pose potential non-carcinogenic health risk. However, it would result
      in carcinogenic effects from the ingestion of trace metals Ni, Cr, and Cd.
      CONCLUSIONS: The data emphasizes the need for the continuous monitoring in this
      industrial region in the future to manage and control pollutant sources and to
      ensure the quality of seafood.

TI  - MoO3 Nanorods Decorated by PbMoO4 Nanoparticles for Enhanced Trimethylamine
      Sensing Performances at Low Working Temperature.
PG  - 24610-24619
LID - 10.1021/acsami.2c04722 [doi]
AB  - The gas sensing performance of metal oxides is limited by the lack of
      conductivity and sensing activity. Inducing the release of more electrons and
      activating more chemisorbed oxygen ions to participate in the gas sensing
      reaction can effectively overcome this limitation. The development of a
      PbMoO4/MoO3 heterostructure prepared by the addition of Pb(2+) ions with MoO3
      nanorods is reported for highly sensitive and selective trimethylamine (TMA)
      detection. The response of the PbMoO4/MoO3 sensor (33.2) to 10 ppm TMA is
      improved 3-fold compared to the MoO3 sensor (10.7), and the working temperature
      is reduced from 170 to 133 degrees C. The enhanced gas sensing performance and
      mechanism of PbMoO4/MoO3 were demonstrated using the energy band diagram and
      X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. It is mainly attributed to the
      following promotion: (1) the induction of Pb(2+) ions increases the electron
      density around the Mo element, enabling the decorated MoO3 to release electrons
      easily; (2) the formed PbMoO4/MoO3 heterojunction endows a high degree of
      electron transfer at the interface; (3) the formation of the potential barrier
      causes the device resistance to decrease significantly upon TMA exposure.
      Finally, the practicability of the sensor was verified by detecting TMA released 
      from Carassius auratus and shrimp to reflect their freshness.

AB  - The cell types and developmental trajectories of shrimp cells based on the
      transcriptional level have not been established, and gene expression profile and 
      function at the single-cell level is unclear. We aimed to use scRNA-seq to
      construct a single-cell resolution transcriptional map of hepatopancreas and
      haemocytes in shrimp to analyse the molecular mechanisms of the immune response
      to ammonia nitrogen stress. In the present study, seven cell clusters were
      successfully identified in each of the two tissues (haemocytes, Hem1-7;
      hepatopancreas, Hep1-7) based on specifically-expressed marker genes. The
      developmental starting points of haemocytes and hepatopancreatic cells were Hem2 
      and Hep1, respectively. We propose that Hem2 has oligopotent potential as the
      initiation site for haemocyte development and that Hem4 and Hem5, located at the 
      end of development, are the most mature immune cell types in haemocytes. Hep5 and
      Hep6 were the developing terminal cells of hepatopancreas. The antioxidant system
      and proPO system of shrimp were activated under ammonia nitrogen stress. A large 
      number of DEGs were involved in oxidative stress, detoxification metabolism, and 
      immune defence. In particular, important response genes such as AMPs, proPO, and 
      GST were not only marker genes for identifying cell groups but also played an
      important role in shrimp cell differentiation and functional plasticity. By
      successfully applying 10x Genomics based scRNA-seq to the study of shrimp, the
      single-cell transcriptional profiles of hepatopancreatic cells and haemocytes of 
      shrimp innate immune responses under ammonia stress were constructed for the
      first time. This atlas of invertebrate hepatopancreatic cells and haemocytes at
      single-cell resolution identifies molecular events that underpin shrimp innate
      immune system responses to stress.

TI  - Improved cholesterol depletion with enhanced astaxanthin and polyunsaturated
      fatty acids of lipid from Pacific white shrimp cephalothorax using prior
      ethanolic separation of polar lipid and beta-Cyclodextrin.
PG  - 2255-2262
LID - 10.1007/s13197-021-05238-7 [doi]
AB  - Shrimp lipid (SL) from Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) cephalothorax 
      was subjected to ethanol separation with subsequent cholesterol removal. Around
      98.4% of cholesterol was removed from cholesterol rich polar lipid fraction
      (PLF), in which PLF/beta cyclodextrin (beta-CD)/mixed solvents (ethyl
      acetate/water,1:1) at the ratio of 1:10:20 (w/w/v) were used. Thereafter, PLF
      with lowered cholesterol was combined with non-polar fraction rich in
      triglycerides to obtain lowered cholesterol shrimp lipid (LC-SL). Astaxanthin
      content in LC-SL was augmented by three-fold, compared to that found in SL.
      Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) contents of LC-SL were
      also significantly increased, contrasted with SL. Peroxide value and
      phospholipids were decreased in LC-SL (4.56 +/- 0.15 meq/kg and 9.94 +/- 1.9%)
      compared to those of SL (4.80 +/- 0.25 meq/kg and 49.11 +/- 2.1%), while TBARS
      and p-Anisidine values remained unchanged. However, conjugated dienes and free
      fatty acids were augmented, plausibly due to hydrolysis. FTIR spectra confirmed
      the increased degree of unsaturation of lipids. Thus, the lowered cholesterol
      shrimp lipid could be used as functional foods or nutraceutical for health
      promotion.

AB  - This paper introduces the lethal, sublethal, and ecotoxic effects of peppermint
      and palmarosa essential oils (EOs) and their polymeric nanoparticles (PNs). The
      physicochemical analyses indicated that peppermint PNs were polydisperse (PDI >
      0.4) with sizes of 381 nm and loading efficiency (LE) of 70.3%, whereas palmarosa
      PNs were monodisperse (PDI < 0.25) with sizes of 191 nm and LE of 89.7%. EOs and 
      their PNs were evaluated on the adults of rice weevil (Sitophilus oryzae L.) and 
      cigarette beetle (Lasioderma serricorne F.) and the larvae of Culex pipiens
      pipiens Say. On S. oryzae and L. serricorne, PNs increased EOs' lethal activity, 
      extended repellent effects for 84 h, and also modified behavioral variables
      during 24 h. Moreover, EOs and PNs generated toxic effects against C. pipiens
      pipiens. On the other hand, peppermint and palmarosa EOs and their PNs were not
      toxic to terrestrial non-target organisms, larvae of mealworm (Tenebrio molitor
      L.), and nymphs of orange-spotted cockroach (Blaptica dubia S.). In addition, PNs
      were slightly toxic to aquatic non-target organisms, such as brine shrimp
      (Artemia salina L.). Therefore, these results show that PNs are a novel and
      eco-friendly formulation to control insect pests.

AB  - The estuarine tapertail anchovy, Coilia nasus, is an anadromous fish that
      undertakes over a 600-km spawning migration along the Yangtze River of China.
      They generally cease feeding during this process, but we recently documented that
      a small proportion of them appear to feed. Research on proteomic responses is
      essential for understanding the phenomenon of C. nasus feeding. In this study, we
      used an iTRAQ-based proteomics approach to study the changes in protein
      expression in response to food intake in C. nasus following voluntary fasting.
      Coilia nasus in the feeding group (CSI) were fed shrimp or small fish, whereas
      those in the control group (CSN) were starved. We identified 3279 proteins in the
      gastric tissue/stomach, of which 279 were significantly differentially expressed.
      In all, 133 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were upregulated and 146
      proteins were downregulated in CSI compared with those in CSN C. nasus. In
      addition to gastric acid secretion caused by gastric distention, a functional
      analysis suggested that a series of DEPs were involved mainly in the regulation
      of protein digestion (e.g., carboxypeptidase A1 and chymotrypsin A-like), immune 
      response (e.g., lysozyme and alpha 2-macroglobulin), and nutrition metabolism
      (e.g., glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, glycogenin, long-chain acyl-CoA 
      synthetase, and creatine kinase). Real-time PCR confirmed that the mRNA levels of
      the DEPs were similar those obtained using iTRAQ. These results indicate that the
      nutrients obtained through food were effectively utilized by C. nasus, thereby
      providing energy for swimming, gonadal maturation, primary metabolism, and an
      enhanced immune function to better resist pathogen interference. This research
      contributes to the elucidation of nutritional regulation mechanisms of C. nasus
      to better protect the wild population.

AB  - Spatial heterogeneity in food web structure and interactions may reconcile
      spatial variation in population and community dynamics in large marine
      ecosystems. In order to assess food web contributions to the different community 
      recovery dynamics along the Newfoundland and Labrador shelf ecosystem, we
      quantified species interactions using stable isotope mixing models and food web
      metrics within three sub-regions. Representative samples of each species caught
      in trawls and plankton tows were analyzed for stomach contents and stable isotope
      ratios (delta15N and delta13C) to parameterize isotope mixing models. Regional
      variation, highlighted by the diets of three economically important species, was 
      observed such that the southern region demonstrated a variety of trophic pathways
      of nutrient flow into the higher food web while the diets of fish in the northern
      regions were typically dominated by one or two pathways via dominant prey
      species, specifically shrimp (Pandalus sp.) and hyperiids. Food web metrics
      indicated that the low-diversity northern regions had higher connectance and
      shorter food chain lengths. This observed regional variation contributes to our
      understanding of the role of specific forage species to the ecosystem which is an
      essential contribution towards ecosystem-based management decisions.

AB  - MYC proto-oncogene (MYC), a first oncogenic nuclear transcription factor isolated
      from the human genome, belongs to the helix loop helix/leucine zipper protein
      family (bHLHzip). MYC plays an important part in the process of various
      physiological and biochemical of vertebrate, such as cell growth, proliferation, 
      cycle, and autophagy. However, its molecular regulation mechanism and function in
      invertebrates are still unclear. In this study, a novel transcription factor MYC 
      gene was screened, cloned, and characterized from Penaeus vannamei. The open
      reading frame of PvMYC was 1593bp, encode a polypeptide of 530 amino acids with
      molecular weight of 58.5 kDa, and a theoretical PI of 5.75. The results of tissue
      distribution showed that PvMYC was constitutively expressed in all detected
      tissues, and highest expression in hepatopancreas. The expression level of PvMYC 
      up-regulated significantly and responded to low temperature stress by nuclear
      ectopic after low temperature stress. Overexpression of PvMYC in shrimp hemocytes
      negatively regulated the expression of Beclin-1 and reduced the conversion from
      LC3I to LC3II, yet p62 was decreased significantly. Meanwhile, RAPA eliminated
      the inhibition of autophagy caused by overexpression of PvMYC. ROS levels and
      autophagy flux showed the similar trend under low temperature stress after
      silencing PvMYC. The expression levels of Beclin-1, key ATG gene and LC3II
      increased significantly, while p62 decreased significantly under the same
      conditions. In addition, the Total hemocyte count (THC) decreased sharply, and
      accelerated the injury of hepatopancreas under low temperature stress after
      silencing PvMYC. Collectively, these results suggest that PvMYC has vital role in
      the cold adaptation mechanism of P. vannamei by negatively regulating autophagy.

TI  - Grass Shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio) as a Trophic Link for Methylmercury
      Accumulation in Urban Salt Marshes.
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.2c01184 [doi]
AB  - Grass shrimp (Palaemonetes pugio) represent a potential link in the transfer of
      methylmercury (MeHg) from salt marsh sediments to transient young-of-the-year
      (YOY) fish. Across six salt marshes subject to varying degrees of Hg
      contamination, MeHg concentration in grass shrimp was significantly correlated
      with MeHg in sediment (p < 0.05, R(2) = 0.81). Bioenergetic models show that
      grass shrimp alone account for 12-90% of MeHg observed in YOY striped bass and
      6-22% of MeHg in YOY summer flounder. Direct accumulation of MeHg from grass
      shrimp to YOY fish increased with MeHg levels in grass shrimp and sediment.
      However, in the most contaminated salt marshes with the highest levels of MeHg in
      grass shrimp and sediment, indirect accumulation of MeHg from grass shrimp by YOY
      summer flounder, whose diet is dominated by benthic forage fish (mummichog), is
      predicted to plateau because higher concentrations of MeHg in grass shrimp are
      offset by a lower proportion of grass shrimp in the mummichog diet. Our results
      demonstrate that grass shrimp are an important trophic link in the
      bioaccumulation of MeHg in salt marsh food webs and that MeHg accumulation in YOY
      fish varies with both the concentration of MeHg in salt marsh sediments and
      benthic food web structure.

TI  - Proteomics analysis reveals a critical role for the WSSV immediate-early protein 
      IE1 in modulating the host prophenoloxidase system.

AB  - White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is a large, enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus
      that threatens shrimp aquaculture worldwide. So far, the mechanisms of WSSV-host 
      interactions are ill-defined. Recent studies have revealed that IE1, an
      immediate-early protein of WSSV, is a multifunctional modulator implicated in
      virus-host interactions. In this study, the functions of IE1 were further
      explored by identifying its interacting proteins using GST-pull down and mass
      spectrometry analysis. A total of 361 host proteins that potentially bind to IE1 
      were identified. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the identified
      IE1-interactors wereinvolved in various signaling pathways such as
      prophenoloxidase (proPO) system, PI3K-AKT, and MAPK. Among these, the regulatory 
      role of IE1 in shrimp proPO system was further studied. The
      Co-immunoprecipitation results confirmed that IE1 interacted with the Ig-like
      domain of Penaeus vannamei proPO or proPO-like protein (hemocyanin).
      Additionally, we found that knockdown of IE1 reduced viral genes expression and
      viral loads and increased the hemocytes' PO activity, whereas recombinant IE1
      protein inhibited the PO activity in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, we
      demonstrated that WSSV could suppress the hemocytes' PO activity at the early
      infection stage. Collectively, our current data indicate that IE1 is a novel
      viral regulator that negatively modulates the shrimp proPO system.

TI  - Considering the influence of land use/land cover on estuarine biotic richness
      with Bayesian hierarchical models.
PG  - e2675
LID - 10.1002/eap.2675 [doi]
AB  - The composition of land use/land cover (LULC) in coastal watersheds has many
      implications for estuarine system ecological function. Land use/land cover can
      influence allochthonous inputs and can enhance or degrade the physical
      characteristics of estuaries, which in turn affects estuaries' ability to support
      local biota. However, these implications for estuaries are often poorly
      considered when assessing the value of lands for conservation. The focus of
      research regarding terrestrial and estuarine interfaces often evaluates how LULC 
      may stress estuarine ecosystems, but in this study we sought to understand how
      LULC may both positively and negatively affect estuaries using measures of
      observed biotic richness as proxies for estuarine function. We investigated the
      influence of LULC on estuarine biotic richness with Bayesian hierarchical models 
      using multiple geospatial data sets from 33 estuaries and their associated
      watersheds along the Gulf of Mexico coastal region of the United States. We
      designed the hierarchical models with observed species richness of three
      functional groups (FGs) (i.e., pelagic fishes, forage fishes, and shrimp) from
      fishery-independent trawl surveys as response variables. We then set salinity and
      water temperature as trawl-specific covariates and measures of influence from six
      LULC classes as estuary-specific covariates and allowed the models to vary by
      estuary, trawl program, salinity, and temperature. The model results indicated
      that the observed richness of each FG was both positively and negatively
      associated with different LULC classes, with estuarine wetlands and forested
      lands demonstrating the strongest positive influences on each FG. The results are
      generally consistent with past studies, and the modeling framework provides a
      promising way to systematically quantify LULC linkages with the biotic health of 
      estuaries for the purposes of potentially valuing the estuarine implications of
      land conservation.

TI  - Monogamy in the Burrowing Shrimp Axianassa australis Rodrigues & Shimizu, 1992
      (Decapoda, Gebiidea, Axianassidae).
PG  - 87-96
LID - 10.1086/719408 [doi]
AB  - Our knowledge of the mating systems in burrowing shrimps (infraorders Axiidea and
      Gebiidea) is still rather limited. Here we describe the burrow use pattern, sex
      ratio, and sexual dimorphism of the burrowing shrimp Axianassa australis to test 
      for monogamy, considering that monogamous species live in heterosexual pairs and 
      exhibit a low degree of sexual dimorphism. To this end, a total of 226
      individuals of A. australis were collected from the northeast region of Brazil.
      Our results showed that A. australis inhabited its burrows mainly as pairs, most 
      of which were male-female pairs. In agreement with the expectations, specimens of
      A. australis were found dwelling as heterosexual pairs more frequently than
      expected by chance alone. The presence of ovigerous females was associated with
      the burrow occupation; that is, brooding females were more frequently observed in
      male-female combinations than solitarily. Also supporting theoretical
      considerations, we did not observe sexual dimorphism in body size between males
      and females of the population and the different categories of the burrow
      occupation. Conversely, sexual dimorphism in cheliped size was evident in the
      population, with larger chelipeds in males than in females. This observation
      agrees with that reported for most burrowing shrimps in which male-male
      competition is the main evolutionary force of sexual selection. The observations 
      above favor the hypothesis that A. australis is primarily monogamous, with a
      small fraction of the males moderately promiscuous.

TI  - Combined efficacy of Cinnamomum zeylanicum and doxorubicin against leukemia
      through regulation of TRAIL and NF-kappa B pathways in rat model.
PG  - 6495-6507
LID - 10.1007/s11033-022-07478-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent discoveries in cancer therapeutics have proven combination
      therapies more effective than individual drugs. This study describes the efficacy
      of the combination of Cinnamomum zeylanicum and doxorubicin against
      benzene-induced leukemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: Brine shrimp assay was used to
      assess the cytotoxicity of C. zeylanicum, doxorubicin and their combination.
      After AML induction in Sprague Dawley rats, the same drugs were given to rat
      groups. Changes in organ weight, haematological profile, and hepatic enzymes were
      determined. Real-time PCR was used to elucidate the effect on the expression of
      STMN1, GAPDH, P53 and various TRAIL and NF-kappaB components. C. zeylanicum
      reduced the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin. The combination treatment showed better 
      anti-leukemic results than any of the individual drugs as evident from STMN1
      expression (p < 0.001). It was particularly effective in reducing total white
      blood cell counts and recovering lymphocytes, monocytes and eosinophils along
      with hepatic enzymes ALT and AST (p < 0.001). All doses recovered relative organ 
      weights and improved blood parameters. The combination therapy was particularly
      effective in inducing apoptosis, inhibition of proliferation marker GAPDH (p <
      0.001) and NF-kappaB pathway components Rel-A (p < 0.001) and Rel-B (p < 0.01).
      Expressions of TRAIL components c-FLIP (p < 0.001), TRAIL ligand (p < 0.001) and 
      caspase 8 (p < 0.01) were also altered. CONCLUSION: Cinnamomum zeylanicum in
      combination with doxorubicin helps to counter benzene-induced cellular and
      hepatic toxicity and improves haematological profile. The anti-leukemic effects
      are potentially due to inhibition of GAPDH and NF-kappa B pathway, and through
      regulation of TRAIL pathway. Our data suggests the use of C. zeylanicum with
      doxorubicin to improve anti-leukemic therapeutic regimes.

AB  - Histamine is the prime culprit of toxicity resulting from seafood consumption,
      whereas conventional detection methods are not convenient to meet the needs of
      rapid histamine analysis nowadays. Based on upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs)
      and inner filter effects (IFE), a novel ratiometric fluorescence nanosystem was
      developed for the efficient detection of histamine. Through pre-treatment with
      solid-phase extraction (SPE) and colorific azo coupling reaction of histamine,
      the fluorescence of UCNPs at 548 nm was quenched, while fluorescence at 664 nm
      was unchanged. Thus, ratiometric fluorescence I548/I664 was inversely
      proportional to histamine concentration at a wide range of 10-200 mg/L. The
      detection limit was 7.34 mg/L, one order of magnitude lower than that of the
      traditional colorimetric method (25 mg/L). In addition, such a convenient and
      environment-friendly detection system was further employed to quantify the
      histamine in fish, shrimp, and shellfish samples, showing excellent application
      potential in seafood safety.

AB  - Betalains are natural nitrogenous water-soluble pigments found in species
      belonging to the Caryophyllales order and in mushrooms. Betalains can be
      considered multifunctional molecules due to their diverse bioactivities such as
      antioxidant, antimicrobial, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory. Furthermore, they 
      can detect pH variations in foods and are considered promising colorimetric
      bioindicators. The bioactivities of betalains have improved their use as active
      and bioactive agents, and colorimetric indicators in the development of edible
      and biodegradable films for foods, which are trends in the food packaging market.
      Thus, this review presents the state-of-art information on the use of betalains
      as a multifunctional molecule in the development of smart, active, and bioactive 
      edible and biodegradable packaging for foods. Studies have revealed that
      betalains can be successfully used to develop: smart films to indicate the
      freshness and spoilage of foods such as shrimp, fish, and chicken; active films
      with antimicrobial and antioxidant potentials to increase the shelf life of
      sausage and shrimp; and bioactive films with health benefits.

TI  - Comparative bioactivity profile of phospholipids from three marine byproducts
      based on the zebrafish model.
PG  - e14229
LID - 10.1111/jfbc.14229 [doi]
AB  - Phospholipids (PLs) are important components of physiological metabolism in
      animals and plants, and they have been widely used in clinical treatment,
      cosmetics, and industry. With the development of marine resources, marine PLs
      rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids have attracted increasing attention. As
      important marine resources, shrimp heads (SH), codfish roe (CR), and squid gonads
      (SG) contain a high PL content. The antithrombotic, antistroke,
      anti-inflammatory, pro-angiogenic, and cardioprotective activities of PLs from
      SH, CR, and SG were evaluated and compared using the in vivo zebrafish model. The
      results showed that the PL extracts of SH, CR, and SG had significant biological 
      activities, which lays a theoretical foundation for the development and
      utilization of PLs in marine byproducts in the future, providing a new choice for
      the prevention of inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases. PRACTICAL
      APPLICATIONS: In this experiment, phospholipids in seafood from different sources
      were extracted, and their biological activities were comprehensively evaluated
      and compared using the zebrafish model to lay a foundation for the development of
      cardiovascular drugs, health food, special medicinal food, and other effective
      components. The utilization of marine byproducts not only makes full use of
      resources, but it also protects the environment.

TI  - Production of biomaterials from seafood waste for application as vegetable wash
      disinfectant.
PG  - e09357
LID - 10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09357 [doi]
AB  - The production of seafood waste was studied by analyzing calcium oxide from the
      shells of tropical oyster and chitosan from the shells of white shrimp to use as 
      a vegetable wash disinfectant. The preparations used were: natural oyster shell
      powder (NOSP), calcined tropical oyster shell powder in a programmable furnace
      for 2 h at 700 degrees C (OSP700), 800 degrees C (OSP800) and 900 degrees C
      (OSP900) including white shrimp shell chitosan (CS). The physical properties of
      all biomaterials were analyzed using Thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray
      diffraction and Fourier-transformed infrared spectrometry. The results showed
      that NOSP and OSP700 were calcite calcium carbonate crystal, but OSP800 and
      OSP900 were transformed to calcium oxide and calcium hydroxide. The amino group
      found in the chitin from white shrimp shell was deacetylated to chitosan. By
      investigating the qualitative antibacterial activity of OSP900 and CS, the
      inhibition zone of OSP900 against E. coli was higher than that of CS (p < 0.05); 
      however, the inhibition zone of CS against S. aureus was higher than that of
      OSP900 (p < 0.05). In addition, OSP900 had significantly higher quantitative
      antibacterial activity against E. coli than S. aureus. The MIC of OSP900 against 
      E. coli and S. aureus for 15 min were 2.5 and 5 mg/mL, respectively; furthermore,
      the MBC of OSP900 against E. coli and S. aureus were 5 and 10 mg/mL,
      respectively. However, the inhibitory activity of CS against S. aureus was higher
      than against E. coli with MIC and MBC values of 5 and 10 mg/mL, respectively, for
      15 min. When testing the biomaterials, OSP900 and CS, to inhibit the bacteria on 
      kale and lettuce, 2.5 mg/mL of OSP900 for a vegetable-washing time of 15 min had 
      the highest E. coli inhibition for both vegetables, while 2.5 mg/mL of CS for the
      same washing time had the highest S. aureus inhibition for both vegetables.
      Therefore, this research indicated that biomaterials prepared from tropical
      oyster shell and white shrimp shell wastes could be used as effective wash
      disinfectants to eliminate contaminated bacteria on vegetables.

AB  - Textile industrial effluents have long enunciated the essentiality of
      ascertaining an efficient wastewater treatment for the removal of azo dyes given 
      their potential disturbances on the ecosystem. Our study investigated the
      efficiency of the strain SKF2 among 14 other isolates, molecularly identified to 
      be Scedosporium apiospermum, isolated by our research group from the textile
      effluent sludge in the degradation of two azo dyes, Reactive Yellow 145 and
      Remazol Yellow RR. Kinetic profiling of the degradation process revealed the
      decolourisation efficiency to be 94.8 and 86.9% for RY 145 and RYRR,
      respectively, during the declining growth phase. Laccase and polyphenol oxidase
      (RY 145-2.37 and RYRR-2.30 U/mL; RY 145-3.26 and RYRR-2.89 U/mL, respectively)
      were found to influence the biodegradation process in both the dyes than the
      other examined fungal degradative enzymes. The metabolic pathway predicted with
      the aid of GC-MS analysis identified the degraded metabolites to be smaller
      molecular weight non-toxic products. Assessment of toxicity via brine shrimp
      lethality assay (RY 145-23.3% and RYRR-16.7%, respectively) and seed germination 
      assay (RY 145-96.7% and RYRR-83.3%) further solidified the detoxified status of
      both the dyes after biodegradation. The experimental data thus substantiated the 
      expediency of S. apiospermum SKF2 in the degradation of textile azo dyes and its 
      further employment in the bioremediation of textile wastewaters for agricultural 
      applications and ecological recycling.

      infection by the ectoparasite Amyloodiniumocellatum.

AB  - The dinoflagellate Amyloodinium ocellatum is an important pathogenic parasite
      infecting cultured marine and brackish water fishes worldwide. This includes
      cultured Florida pompano (Trachinotus carolinus), which is one of the most
      desirable marine food fish with high economic value in the USA. A. ocellatum
      infects fish gills and causes tissue damage, increased respiratory rate, reduced 
      appetite, and mortality, especially in closed aquaculture systems. This study
      mimicked the natural infection of A. ocellatum in cultured pompano and conducted 
      a transcriptomic comparison of gene expression in the gills of control and A.
      ocellatum infected fish to explore the molecular mechanisms of infection. RNA-seq
      data revealed 604 differentially expressed genes in the infected fish gills. The 
      immunoglobulin genes (including IgM/T) augmentation and IL1 inflammation
      suppression were detected after infection. Genes involved in reactive oxygen
      species mediating parasite killing were also highly induced. However, excessive
      oxidants have been linked to oxidative tissue damage and apoptosis.
      Correspondingly, widespread down-regulation of collagen genes and growth factor
      deprivation indicated impaired tissue repair, and meanwhile the key executor of
      apoptosis, caspase-3 was highly expressed (25.02-fold) in infected fish. The
      infection also influenced the respiratory gas sensing and transport genes and
      established hypoxic conditions in the gill tissue. Additionally, food intake and 
      lipid metabolism were also affected. Our work provides the transcriptome
      sequencing of Florida pompano and provides key insights into the acute
      pathogenesis of A. ocellatum. This information can be utilized for designing
      optimal disease surveillance strategies, future selection for host resistance,
      and development of novel therapeutic measures.

AB  - The effects of different ultrasonic pretreatments (120-600 W, 20 min; 360 W,
      10-30 min) on the gel properties of shrimp surimi were investigated. Gel
      properties and protein functional properties were analysed to clarify the
      mechanism of action of ultrasound. The gel strength, water holding capacity and
      surface hydrophobicity of shrimp surimi gel increased initially and then
      decreased with the increase in ultrasound power or time, but the change in total 
      sulfhydryl content showed the opposite trend, which indicated that proper
      ultrasound pretreatment could improve the gel properties of shrimp surimi, expand
      the protein to a greater extent and expose more SH groups and hydrophobic groups.
      According to scanning electron microscopy observation, ultrasound made shrimp
      surimi gel form a denser gel network. Fourier transform infrared analysis
      indicated that the alpha-helix content in shrimp surimi gel decreased initially
      and then increased with the increase of in ultrasound power or time, whereas the 
      change in beta-sheet content showed the opposite trend. And the protein was the
      most stable in 360 W/20 min pretreatment. SDS-PAGE patterns showed that proper
      ultrasound inhibited the degradation of actin and troponin C. In addition,
      dynamic rheology illustrated that the G' values of the ultrasonic pretreatment
      group were higher than that of the control group, indicating that ultrasound
      could improve the elasticity and stability of shrimp surimi gel. The results
      suggested that the shrimp surimi gel pretreated by 360 W/20 min ultrasound showed
      the best gel properties. Furthermore, the correlation between the indexes
      affecting the properties of the gel was analyzed. This study provides a new
      technical means to improve the gel properties of shrimp surimi.

AB  - Increasing trends in food safety awareness drive consumer demands for fresher
      healthier diets and has led to the development of low-cost pH-sensitive indicator
      films to evaluate deterioration levels in fresh foods. Arrowroot
      starch/iota-carrageenan-based films were combined with 10, 30, 50% Kyoho skin
      extract (KSE) to produce indicator films with halochromic abilities. The KSE
      indicator films were characterized based on their physico-mechanical, functional,
      and crystallinity properties; thermal stability; and their pH-dependent color
      changes in in situ anthocyanin-based monitoring of shrimp freshness. All KSE
      indicator films displayed compact structure under scanning electron microscope
      analysis and increased tensile strength, exhibited UV-vis barrier ability, and
      presented low water wettability. Moreover, FTIR signaled strong hydrogen bond
      interactions among polymers and KSE that strengthened peak crystallinity in XRD
      analysis and lowered weight loss at melting temperature, which indicated thermal 
      stability of the indicator films. Furthermore, pH-sensitivity of the indicator
      films integrated with natural KSE anthocyanin demonstrated color changes from
      purple to red under acidic conditions, purple to green in an ammonium
      environment, and yellow appeared in high alkaline conditions. Finally, this study
      demonstrated the food packaging and halochromic capacity of biopolymer-based
      pH-sensitivity of the KSE indicator films in real-time monitoring of shrimp at
      room storage temperatures.

AB  - The intestinal microbiota of the Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei during
      Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP) infection was investigated by 16S rRNA
      gene-based analysis. The results showed that bacterial diversity in the intestine
      of L. vannamei was high, but it decreased with increasing severity of EHP
      infection. The relative abundances of the phyla Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria
      and Acidobacteria decreased significantly with a decrease in body size or EHP
      infection severity (P < 0.05). The most abundant genera were Pseudomonas,
      Methylobacterium, Bradyrhizobium, Bacteroides, Vibrio, Prevotella and so on. In
      addition, the relative abundances of some bacteria, such as Pseudomonas,
      Bradyrhizobium, Bacteroides and Vibrio, increased significantly with a decrease
      in body size or EHP infection severity (P < 0.05). These findings suggest that
      changes in the intestinal microbiota occur depending on the severity of EHP
      infection.

TI  - Comprehending the allergen repertoire of shrimp for precision molecular diagnosis
      of shrimp allergy.
LID - 10.1111/all.15370 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical management of shrimp allergy is hampered by the lack of
      accurate tests. Molecular diagnosis has been shown to more accurately reflect the
      clinical reactivity but the full spectrum of shrimp allergens and their clinical 
      relevance are yet to be established. We therefore sought to comprehend the
      allergen repertoire of shrimp, investigate and compare the sensitization pattern 
      and diagnostic value of the allergens in allergic subjects of two distinct
      populations. METHODS: Sera were collected from 85 subjects with challenge-proven 
      or doctor-diagnosed shrimp allergy in Hong Kong and Thailand. The IgE-binding
      proteins of Penaeus monodon were probed by Western blotting and identified by
      mass spectrometry. Recombinant shrimp allergens were synthesized and analyzed for
      IgE sensitization by ELISA. RESULTS: Ten IgE-binding proteins were identified,
      and a comprehensive panel of 11 recombinant shrimp allergens was generated. The
      major shrimp allergens among Hong Kong subjects were troponin C (Pen m 6) and
      glycogen phosphorylase (Pen m 14, 47.1%), tropomyosin (Pen m 1, 41.2%) and
      sarcoplasmic-calcium binding protein (Pen m 4, 35.3%), while those among Thai
      subjects were Pen m 1 (68.8%), Pen m 6 (50.0%) and fatty acid-binding protein
      (Pen m 13, 37.5%). Component-based tests yielded significantly higher area under 
      curve values (0.77-0.96) than shrimp extract-IgE test (0.70-0.75). Yet the best
      component test differed between populations; Pen m 1-IgE test added diagnostic
      value only in the Thai cohort, whereas sensitizations to other components were
      better predictors of shrimp allergy in Hong Kong patients. CONCLUSION: Pen m 14
      was identified as a novel shrimp allergen predictive of challenge outcome.
      Molecular diagnosis better predicts shrimp allergy than conventional tests, but
      the relevant component is population dependent.

TI  - Semi-Synthesis of N-Aryl Amide Analogs of Piperine from Piper nigrum and
      Evaluation of Their Antitrypanosomal, Antimalarial, and Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Main
      Protease Activities.
LID - 2841 [pii]

AB  - Piper nigrum, or black pepper, produces piperine, an alkaloid that has diverse
      pharmacological activities. In this study, N-aryl amide piperine analogs were
      prepared by semi-synthesis involving the saponification of piperine (1) to yield 
      piperic acid (2) followed by esterification to obtain compounds 3, 4, and 5. The 
      compounds were examined for their antitrypanosomal, antimalarial, and
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 main protease activities. The new 2,5-dimethoxy-substituted
      phenyl piperamide 5 exhibited the most robust biological activities with no
      cytotoxicity against mammalian cell lines, Vero and Vero E6, as compared to the
      other compounds in this series. Its half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) 
      for antitrypanosomal activity against Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense was 15.46
      +/- 3.09 muM, and its antimalarial activity against the 3D7 strain of Plasmodium 
      falciparum was 24.55 +/- 1.91 muM, which were fourfold and fivefold more potent, 
      respectively, than the activities of piperine. Interestingly, compound 5
      inhibited the activity of 3C-like main protease (3CL(Pro)) toward anti-SARS-CoV-2
      activity at the IC50 of 106.9 +/- 1.2 muM, which was threefold more potent than
      the activity of rutin. Docking and molecular dynamic simulation indicated that
      the potential binding of 5 in the 3CL(pro) active site had the improved binding
      interaction and stability. Therefore, new aryl amide analogs of piperine 5 should
      be investigated further as a promising anti-infective agent against human African
      trypanosomiasis, malaria, and COVID-19.

TI  - In Silico Prediction of Cross-Reactive Epitopes of Tropomyosin from Shrimp and
      Other Arthropods Involved in Allergy.
LID - 2667 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27092667 [doi]
AB  - Tropomyosin in shellfish is considered a major cross-reactive allergen in house
      dust mites and cockroaches; however, the specific epitopes have not been
      elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the consensus antigenic
      determinant among shrimp, house dust mites, and cockroaches using in silico
      methods. The protein sequences of tropomyosin, including Der f 10, Mac r 1, Pen a
      1, Pen m 1, Per a 7, and Bla g 7, were retrieved from the UniProt database. The
      3D structures were derived from the AlphaFold or modeled using the Robetta. The
      determination of linear epitopes was performed by AlgPRED and BepiPRED for B cell
      epitope, and NetMHCIIpan and NetMHCII for T cell epitope, while Ellipro was used 
      to evaluate conformational epitopes. Fourteen peptides were discovered as the
      consensus linear B cell epitopes, while seventeen peptides were identified as
      linear T cell epitopes specific to high-frequency HLA-DR and HLA-DQ alleles. The 
      conformational determination of B cell epitopes provided nine peptides, in which 
      residues 209, 212, 255-256, and 258-259 were found in both linear B cell and
      linear T cell epitope analysis. This data could be utilized for further in vitro 
      study and may contribute to immunotherapy for allergic diseases associated with
      tropomyosin.

TI  - Determination of the Most Efficient Household Technique for the Reduction of
      Pesticide Residues from Raw Fish Muscles.
LID - 1254 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/foods11091254 [doi]
AB  - Substantial quantities of pesticides are routinely applied to enhance
      agricultural crop production. Pesticides used in this way continuously accumulate
      in the environment and in foods. Harvested crops contain pesticide residues at
      various concentrations, with potential harmful impacts on human health. Hence, it
      is of value to identify techniques for the effective decontamination of tainted
      foods. However, cleaning with water or household agents, e.g., acetic acid and
      sodium bicarbonate, are recognized treatments for the efficient degradation of
      pesticides from vegetables and fruits. There is an apparent void of information
      about the decontamination treatments for raw fishes using household agents that
      are affordable for all classes of consumers. Hence, the present study was
      performed to determine the most efficient household technique for reducing
      pesticide residue levels from precooked raw fish to ensure the utmost food
      safety. Fish muscles of four species of fishes, viz., Clarias gariepinus, Channa 
      striatus, Anabas testudineus and Trichogaster trichopterus, were treated with six
      treatments: washing with running tap water (T1), dipping in normal water (T2),
      dipping in 2% salt solution (T3), dipping in 2% vinegar (T4), dipping in 0.1%
      sodium bicarbonate solution (T5) as well as dipping in 0.1% sodium bicarbonate
      solution + 2% vinegar + 2% salt solution + lemon juice (T6), as fish muscle is
      the major consumable portion of fish. The current study demonstrated that the
      removal percentage of lindane, heptachlor, aldrin, endosulfan, dieldrin, endrin, 
      DDT, methoxychlor and cypermethrin residues against the treated household
      treatments, in downward order, were soaking in 0.1% sodium bicarbonate solution +
      2% vinegar + 2% salt solution + lemon juice solution (T6) &gt; soaking in 2%
      vinegar (T4) solution &gt; soaking in 0.1% sodium bicarbonate (T5) solution &gt; 
      soaking in 2% salt (T3) solution &gt; washing with running tap water (T1) &gt;
      soaking in stable normal water (T2). The treatment of raw fish muscle samples by 
      soaking them in 0.1% sodium bicarbonate solution + 2% vinegar + 2% salt solution 
      + lemon juice was found to be the most efficient household treatment, performing 
      significant reductions (%) in pesticide concentration: 72-80% (p &lt; 0.05) in
      Channa striata, 71-79% (p &lt; 0.05) in Clarias gariepinus, 74-80% (p &lt; 0.05) 
      in Anabas testudineus as well as 78-81% (p &lt; 0.05) in Trichogaster
      trichopterus before cooking.

TI  - Toxicity, Antioxidant Activity, and Phytochemicals of Basil (Ocimum basilicum L.)
      Leaves Cultivated in Southern Punjab, Pakistan.
LID - 1239 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/foods11091239 [doi]
AB  - Basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) is one of the most common aromatic herbs, a rich
      source of bioactive compounds, and is used extensively to add aroma and flavor to
      food. The leaves, both in fresh and dried form, are used as a culinary ingredient
      in different cultures. O. basilicum is also famous for its therapeutic potential 
      and preservation effects. The present study investigated the cytotoxicity of
      basil at three different growth stages (GS), i.e., GS-1 (58 days of growth), GS-2
      (69 days of growth), and GS-3 (93 days of growth) using the brine shrimp
      lethality assay. The results revealed that cytotoxicity was influenced by GS and 
      the concentration of extracts. Aqueous extracts of basil at a concentration of 10
      to 1000 microg/mL did not show notable toxicity. The lowest mortality rate, i.e.,
      8.9%, was recorded for GS-2 at the highest tested dose of basil extracts. The
      mortality rate at GS-1, GS-2, and GS-3 was found to be 26.7 +/- 3.34%, 8.91 +/-
      0.10%, and 16.7 +/- 0.34%, respectively, at 1000 microg/mL. GS-2 basil powder
      with the lowest toxicological risk was extracted with different solvents, viz.,
      n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethanol, and water. The highest concentration of plant
      secondary metabolites including total phenolic acid, flavonoids, and tannin
      content was observed in ethanol extracts. Ethanol extracts also exhibited the
      highest antioxidant activity in DPPH, FRAP and H2O2 assays. LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis
      presented ethanol extracts of basil as a promising source of known
      health-promoting and therapeutic compounds such as rosmarinic acid, ellagic acid,
      catechin, liquiritigenin, and umbelliferone. The results suggest basil, a
      culinary ingredient, as a potential source of bioactive compounds which may offer
      an array of health promoting and therapeutic properties.

TI  - Supplementation of ex situ produced bioflocs improves immune response against
      AHPND in Pacific whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) postlarvae.
PG  - 3751-3764
LID - 10.1007/s00253-022-11966-3 [doi]
AB  - The emergence of Vibrio diseases, including acute hepatopancreatic necrosis
      disease (AHPND) caused by Vibrio spp., had resulted in heavy losses in global
      shrimp production. Biofloc technology is a closed aquaculture system developed as
      one of the sustainable solutions to increase system resilience in the shrimp
      industry. In this study, biofloc was formed externally (ex situ biofloc) with
      probiotics Bacillus sp. strain BME and Bacillus sp. strain BCE, diatom microalgae
      Chaetoceros calcitrans, and a consortium of nitrifying bacteria, in the ratio of 
      1:1:6:6 as a starter. The study showed that the ex situ biofloc supplementation
      in Pacific whiteleg shrimp (L. vannamei) postlarvae culture can increase the
      shrimp culture performance (shrimp survival and growth), reduce Vibrio counts in 
      the water and shrimp body, and provide stimulation of the shrimp immune response 
      through humoral immune responses, such as pattern recognition protein (C-type
      lectin) and melanization process (proPO). Overall, the results indicate that the 
      supplementation of ex situ biofloc provided protection to shrimp under Vibrio
      infection, regardless of the timing of addition (before, simultaneously, or after
      addition of Vibrio sp. strain VPA). This suggests that the ex situ biofloc can be
      effective as a preventive and a supportive treatment against potential AHPND
      infection in L. vannamei postlarvae culture. Taken together, the ability of the
      ex situ biofloc to modulate immune-related gene expression and resistance of L.
      vannamei against potentially AHPND-causing Vibrio sp. strain makes it an
      effective aquaculture technology for infectious disease control in shrimp
      production with high-density and minimal water exchange culture. KEY POINTS: *
      Supplementation of ex situ produced biofloc in shrimp postlarvae culture. * Ex
      situ biofloc reduces Vibrio counts in the water and shrimp body. * Ex situ
      biofloc stimulates shrimp humoral immune responses and survival.

TI  - Shrimp thrombospondin (TSP): presence of O-beta1,4 N-acetylglucosamine polymers
      and its function in TSP chain association in egg extracellular matrix.
PG  - 7925
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-11873-7 [doi]
AB  - We characterized the existence of O-beta(1,4)-GlcNAc polymers (beta1,4GNP) that
      were anchored on the O-linked glycosylation sites of shrimp thrombospondin
      (pmTSP-II). There were five putative beta1,4GNP linkages on the epithelial growth
      factor-like domain of pmTSP-II. Antibody against O-beta-GlcNAc (CTD110.6) was
      used to prove the existence of linear and complex beta1,4GNP. The antibody well
      reacted with linear chito-triose, -tetraose and -pentaose conjugated with
      phosphatidylethanolamine lipid. The immunoreactivity could also be detected with 
      a complex beta1,4GNP within pmTSP-II (at MW > 250 kDa). Upon denaturing the
      protein with SDS-PAGE buffer, the size of pmTSP-II was shifted to be 250 kDa,
      approximately 2.5 folds larger than the deduced molecular mass of pmTSP-II (110
      kDa), suggesting additional association of pmTSP-II apart from its known
      disulfide bridging. This was confirmed by chitinase digestion on pmTSP-II protein
      leading to the subsequent smaller protein bands at 110-170 kDa in time- and
      concentration-dependent manners. These bands well reacted with CTD110.6 antibody 
      and disappeared after extensive chitinase hydrolysis. Together, we believe that
      beta1,4GNP on pmTSP-II serve the function in an inter-chain association to
      provide structural architecture of egg extracellular matrix, a novel function of 
      pmTSP-II in reproductive biology.

AB  - Active/intelligent packaging films were developed by incorporating purple
      sweetpotato anthocyanins (PSA) and purple cabbage anthocyanins (PCA) in locust
      bean gum/polyvinyl alcohol (LP), chitosan/polyvinyl alcohol (CP) and
      kappa-carrageenan/polyvinyl alcohol (KP) film matrices. The joint effect of
      anthocyanins' source and polysaccharides' nature on the structure and
      functionality of the films was determined. Results showed PSA and PCA interacted 
      with film matrices through hydrogen bonds and/or electrostatic interactions,
      resulting in improved film uniformity. PSA and PCA did not remarkably alter the
      water vapor permeability and tensile strength of the films; however,
      significantly improved the light barrier ability, antioxidant activity,
      pH-sensitivity and ammonia-sensitivity of films. For the films containing the
      same anthocyanins (PSA or PCA), LP-based films had relatively higher light
      barrier ability and storage stability, while CP-based had relatively weaker color
      changeable ability. When PSA and PCA were immobilized in the same film matrix,
      the films containing PCA had higher light barrier ability and antioxidant
      activity than the films containing PSA. Among the films, LP-PCA film exhibited a 
      good potential to monitor the freshness of shrimp. Results suggested the
      structure and functionality of the films were influenced by the source of
      anthocyanins and the nature of polysaccharides.

TI  - Application of high-pressure assisted thermal processing (PATP) at pilot scale
      for replacing conventional maturation and thermal cooking in whiteleg shrimp
      (Litopenaeus vannamei).
LID - 10.1002/jsfa.12013 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this work was to examine for the first time the use of
      high-pressure assisted thermal processing (PATP) (100, 350, 600 MPa; 100 degrees 
      C; 3 min) at pilot scale for replacing shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) maturation
      and cooking, analyzing its impact on peeling yield, color, texture and sensory
      properties. Shrimps subjected to conventional maturation (ice; 2 days) and
      thermal cooking (100 degrees C; boiling water, 3 min) were used as controls.
      RESULTS: PATP treatments at 100-350 MPa improved manual peelability over the
      control (P </= 0.05), maintaining similar peeling yield, color (L*, a*, b*),
      texture (shear force, shear work) and sensory properties (appearance before and
      after peeling, flavor, firmness; P < 0.05). However, increasing pressure to 600
      MPa clearly overprocessed the samples, making it impossible to remove all the
      meat from the shell and resulting in a softer texture, 4.1% lower peeling yield
      and worse sensory quality (P </= 0.05). CONCLUSION: PATP (< 350 MPa; 100 degrees 
      C) could be an alternative to replace conventional maturation and thermal cooking
      in the production of cooked shrimps, reducing processing time from days to
      minutes by performing both processes in a single step. (c) 2022 Society of

TI  - Highly efficient adsorption of Bisphenol A using NaHCO3/CO2 activated carbon
      composite derived from shrimp shell@cellulose.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-20564-9 [doi]
AB  - In this study, the efficiency of activated carbon (AC) synthesized from the
      shrimp shell plus cellulose (SS@C) was optimized toward Bisphenol A (BPA)
      adsorption. Low-cost, renewable, and non-toxic shrimp shells mixed with cellulose
      were carbonized, followed by activation via CO2 and NaHCO3 to produce SS@C-AC.
      The results revealed that SS@C-AC samples were a porous composite with mesoporous
      structures comprising a relatively high specific surface area (935.20 m(2)/g)
      with a mean pore size of around 3.8 nm and mesoporous volume of 1.83E-02 cm(3)/g.
      The influences of initial concentrations, pH values, and adsorption on BPA were
      investigated systematically. Isotherm model and kinetics study of the adsorption 
      of BPA on SS@C-AC exhibited that the obtained data were in agreement with the
      Langmuir adsorption isotherm model while there is no difference between PFO and
      PSO kinetic results for BPA concentrations in the range 25-100 mg/L. The
      impregnation ratio of 1.5 NaHCO3 and an activation time of 90 min at 800 degrees 
      C were the optimum conditions under which BPA removal of 81.78% was obtained.

TI  - Rollback, scissor-like closure of the Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean and formation of an
      orocline: magmatic migration based on a large archive of age data.
PG  - nwab210

AB  - Tracing the closure of oceans with irregular margins and the formation of an
      orocline are crucial for understanding plate reconstruction and continental
      assembly. The eastern Central Asian Orogenic Belt, where the Mongol-Okhotsk
      orocline is situated, is one of the world's largest magmatic provinces. Using a
      large data set of U-Pb zircon ages, we updated the timing of many published
      igneous rocks, which allowed us to recognize tightly 'folded' linear
      Carboniferous-Jurassic magmatic belts that wrap around the Mongol-Okhotsk suture 
      and their migrations both sutureward and suture-parallel. The new successive
      magmatic belts reveal a rollback, scissor-like (or zipper-like) closure of the
      Mongol-Okhotsk Ocean that was fundamentally controlled by coeval subduction
      rollback and rotation of the Siberian and Mongolian-Erguna blocks. This study
      also demonstrates the complex mechanisms and processes of the closure of an ocean
      with irregular margins and the formation of a consequent orocline.

AB  - Haematococcus pluvialis can be used as a green additive in aquafeeds due to it
      contains rich astaxanthin and polyunsaturated fatty acid. In the present study, a
      newly strain of H. pluvialis GXU-A23 with high concentration of astaxanthin was
      firstly isolated by a newly culture strategy in our laboratory. In addition, H.
      pluvialis GXU-A23 was applied in the Litopenaeus vannamei feed for determining
      whether it has positive effects on the growth performance, antioxidant and
      anti-inflammatory status, metabolic capacity and mid-intestine morphology of
      juvenile L. vannamei. Shrimp with 0.63 g approximately initial body weight were
      fed diets supplemented with/without 50 g/kg H. pluvialis GXU-A23. After 8 weeks
      feeding intervention, significantly higher growth performance of L. vannamei was 
      obtained in the H. pluvialis GXU-A23 treatment group compared to the control
      group (p < 0.05). At the same time, L. vannamei fed with H. pluvialis GXU-A23
      acquired significantly better antioxidant and anti-inflammatory status than the
      control group (p < 0.05). In addition, higher RNA expression level of
      hepatopancreas digestive enzyme, hepatopancreas lipid and glucose metabolic
      enzymes as well as better mid-intestine morphology were found in the H. pluvialis
      GXU-A23 treatment group than the control group (p < 0.05). These results
      indicated that 50 g/kg H. pluvialis GXU-A23 was suitable for the L. vannamei
      feed, which could improve the growth performance, antioxidant and
      anti-inflammatory status, metabolic capacity and mid-intestine morphology of
      juvenile L. vannamei.

      Streptomyces chilikensis RC1830, isolated from Chilika Lake, India.
PG  - 120
LID - 10.1007/s13205-022-03184-5 [doi]
AB  - Streptomyces chilikensis RC1830 was previously isolated as a novel chitinolytic
      streptomycete from Chilika Lake, Odisha, India. The strain RC1830 is a
      representative member of the soil-dwelling, filamentous Streptomyces group that
      produces the majority of natural antibiotics and secondary metabolites. The
      objective of this work was to assess the chitin degradation ability and
      whole-genome sequence of Streptomyces chilikensis RC1830. TLC analysis of the
      fermentation product revealed that strain RC1830 can convert shrimp shell
      colloidal chitin to N-acetylated chitooligosaccharides (N-AcCOS). A genome-wide
      investigation of RC1830 was also carried out to investigate the genetic basis for
      chitin breakdown. The result showed that the RC1830 genome possesses a chromosome
      with 7,121,774 bp (73.2% GC). The genome consists of 6807 coding sequences, 69
      tRNA, and 3 rRNA genes. Furthermore, carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) analysis
      revealed that RC1830 has 89 glycoside hydrolase family genes, which could
      modulate the enzymes involved in the degradation of chitin ultimately producing
      industrially important COS. The whole-genome information of RC1830 could
      emphasize the mechanism involved in the RC1830's chitin breakdown activity,
      endowing RC1830 with a promising alternative for COS production. Supplementary

TI  - Microsporidian Pathogens of Aquatic Animals.
PG  - 247-283
LID - 10.1007/978-3-030-93306-7_10 [doi]
AB  - Around 57.1% of microsporidia occupy aquatic environments, excluding a further
      25.7% that utilise both terrestrial and aquatic systems. The aquatic
      microsporidia therefore compose the most diverse elements of the Microsporidia
      phylum, boasting unique structural features, variable transmission pathways, and 
      significant ecological influence. From deep oceans to tropical rivers, these
      parasites are present in most aquatic environments and have been shown to infect 
      hosts from across the Protozoa and Animalia. The consequences of infection range 
      from mortality to intricate behavioural change, and their presence in aquatic
      communities often alters the overall functioning of the ecosystem.In this
      chapter, we explore aquatic microsporidian diversity from the perspective of
      aquatic animal health. Examples of microsporidian parasitism of importance to an 
      aquacultural ('One Health') context and ecosystem context are focussed upon.
      These include infection of commercially important penaeid shrimp by
      Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei and interesting hyperparasitic microsporidians of
      wild host groups.Out of ~1500 suggested microsporidian species, 202 have been
      adequately taxonomically described using a combination of ultrastructural and
      genetic techniques from aquatic and semi-aquatic hosts. These species are our
      primary focus, and we suggest that the remaining diversity have additional
      genetic or morphological data collected to formalise their underlying
      systematics.

AB  - It is of particular intrigue to synthesize, analyze anti-bacterial,
      anti-inflammatory activity, cytotoxicity effect of clove and cardamom reinforced 
      zirconium oxide nanoparticles to coat the orthodontic archwires and study its
      ramifications. Characterization of nanoparticles was done using Transmission
      electron microscopic analysis (TEM). Antimicrobial activity was assessed using
      agar well diffusion method. Cytotoxic effect was assessed using Brine Shrimp
      Assay. Anti-inflammatory activity was completed using Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA).
      A Digital magnetic stirrer with a hot plate was used to coat orthodontic arch
      wires such as NiTi and SS. TEM spherical shape was of size 5 -20 nm. Minimal
      cytotoxicity was observed at 50 microL. Anti-inflammatory property was fair.
      Antimicrobial activity against Lactobacillus species, streptococcus mutans
      staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans was recorded. NiTi and SS showed a
      colour shift from silver to orange red with a uniform surface coating on wires.
      Thus, green synthesized zirconium oxide nanoparticles have potent antimicrobial, 
      anti-inflammatory properties with minimal cytotoxicity for further consideration 
      as nano-coatings on orthodontic archwires such as NiTi and Stainless Steel.

TI  - Adhesion and Colonization of the Probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum HC-2 in the
      Intestine of Litopenaeus Vannamei Are Associated With Bacterial Surface Proteins.
PG  - 878874
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.878874 [doi]
AB  - Surface proteins are a type of proteins expressed on the surface of bacteria that
      play an important role in cell wall synthesis, maintenance of cell morphology,
      and signaling with the host. Our previous study showed that the probiotic
      Lactobacillus plantarum HC-2 improved the growth performance and immune response 
      of Litopenaeus vannamei. To further investigate the probiotic mechanism, we
      determined the automatic aggregation ability of the bacteria and surface
      hydrophobicity of HC-2 after being treated with 5 M of lithium chloride (LiCl)
      and observed the morphology and adhesion of the bacteria to HCT116 cells. The
      results showed that with the removal of the HC-2 surface protein, the
      auto-aggregation ability and surface hydrophobicity of HC-2 decreased, and the
      crude mucus layer coated on the bacterial surface gradually dissociated. The
      adhesion rate of HC-2 to HCT116 cells decreased from 98.1 to 20.9%. Moreover, a
      total of 201 unique proteins were identified from the mixture of the surface
      proteins by mass spectrometry (MS). Several proteins are involved in
      transcription and translation, biosynthetic or metabolic process, cell cycle or
      division, cell wall synthesis, and emergency response. Meanwhile, a quantitative 
      real-time PCR qPCR_ showed that HC-2 was mainly colonized in the midgut of
      shrimp, and the colonization numbers were 15 times higher than that in the
      foregut, while the colonization rate in the hindgut was lower. The adhesion
      activity measurement showed that the adhesion level of HC-2 to crude intestinal
      mucus of L. vannamei was higher than that of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and
      collagen, and the adhesion capacity of the bacterial cells decreased with the
      extension of LiCl-treatment time. Finally, we identified the elongation factor
      Tu, Type I glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, small heat shock protein,
      and 30S ribosomal protein from the surface proteins, which may be the adhesion
      proteins of HC-2 colonization in the shrimp intestine. The above results indicate
      that surface proteins play an important role in maintaining the cell structure
      stability and cell adhesion. Surface proteomics analysis contributes to
      describing potential protein-mediated probiotic-host interactions. The
      identification of some interacting proteins in this work may be beneficial to
      further understand the adhesion/colonization mechanism and probiotic properties
      of L. plantarum HC-2 in the shrimp intestine.

AB  - Several naturally occurring biopolymers are commercially produced from livestock 
      and farmed animals processing wastes, including aquatic organisms. These wastes
      are considered valuable coproducts of fishery processing industry, from which
      biopolymers may be recovered and exploited for their bioactive potential. The aim
      of this work was to prepare polymeric films from collagen and chitosan solutions,
      extracted from fishery discards, and investigate the cytotoxicity and
      immunomodulatory activity towards human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
      (PBMCs). PBMCs were isolated from healthy donors and treated with Chitosan,
      Collagen, Chitosan+Collagen solutions and Chitosan+Collagen film in order to
      measure the changes in cell viability, cytosolic calcium concentration
      ([Ca(2+)]cyt), mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim), reactive oxygen
      species (ROS) levels, differentiation and activation of T CD8(+) and CD4(+)
      lymphocytes, and cytokine production. Results showed that collagen and chitosan
      preparations did not show cytotoxic effect, while cellular IL-6, IL-10, and
      TNF-alpha release was observed. Chitosan and collagen were able to promote
      non-cytotoxic PBMCs activation through cytosolic and mitochondrial ROS
      production. There was a noteworthy phenotyping of lymphocytes T CD8(+) and CD4(+)
      counting and an increase of [Ca(2+)] cyt and DeltaPsim levels. These results
      suggest that chitosan/collagen-based biomaterials produce immunostimulatory
      effects on PBMC with potential to biomedical approaches.

AB  - Changes in physicochemical, textural, microbial, and sensory quality of
      harpiosquillid mantis shrimp (Harpiosquilla raphidea) (HMS) during 10 days of
      iced storage were studied. Weight and cooking losses were increased during
      storage (p < 0.05). Drastic decrease in myosin heavy chain was found after 2 days
      of storage. Increases in total volatile basic nitrogen, trimethylamine, peroxide 
      value, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances with coincidentally augmented 
      pH were found during the storage (p < 0.05). For microbiological analyses, total 
      viable counts exceeded the limit at day 6. Melanosis score increased with a
      decreased L* value as storage time increased. Rapid decreases in hardness,
      springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, and chewiness were associated with pasty
      and softened texture, which was supported by looser arrangement of muscle fiber
      along with gapping. This was reconfirmed by lowered shear force. Based on the
      quality evaluation, HMS could maintain the freshness and quality for not longer
      than 2 days in ice.

AB  - Zinc and its derivatives requirement increased to enhance human immunity against 
      the different pandemics, including covid-19. Green synthesis is an emerging field
      of research. Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles have been prepared from Anoectochilus
      elatus and characterized using absorption, vibrational and electron microscope
      analysis. They were carried for antibacterial, inflammatory control tendency, and
      potential antioxidant activities. The brine shrimp lethal assay tested the
      biologically derived nanomaterial toxicity and the lethal concentration (LC50) is
      599.79 microg/ml. The inhibition against the important disease-causing pathogens 
      was measured against four-gram negative, gram-positive bacteria and two fungus
      pathogens. The nanomaterial exposed inhibition zone for gram-positive bacteria
      between 17 mm and 25 mm. The inhibition zone against gram-negative bacteria
      exists between 19 mm and 24 mm. The anti-inflammatory activity was assessed by
      inhibition of protein denaturation and protease inhibitory activity using
      nanomaterial. The antioxidant activity was examined using four assays for the
      therapeutic activities. The average size range of 60-80 nm nanoparticles has
      prepared and exposed the good biological activity between 50 microg/ml and 100
      microg/ml. The comparative results of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant assay
      results with standards such as Aspirin and vitamin C exposed that two to three
      times higher concentrations are required for the fifty percent of inhibitions.
      The prepared low-cost nanoparticle has exhibited excellent biological activity
      without any side effects and may enhance immunity.

TI  - Improvement in the probiotic efficacy of Bacillus subtilis E20-stimulates growth 
      and health status of white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei via encapsulation in
      alginate and coated with chitosan.

AB  - The aim of this study was to increase the efficacy of probiotic Bacillus subtilis
      E20 by encapsulating the probiotic in alginate and coating it with chitosan. The 
      protective effect was evaluated by firstly ensuring the viability of encapsulated
      probiotics in simulated gastrointestinal fluid (SGF) and simulated intestinal
      fluid (SIF) conditions and then at different storage temperatures. In addition,
      the encapsulated probiotic was incorporated into the diet to improve the growth
      performance and health status of white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei. B. subtilis 
      E20 has the ability to survive in SGF when encapsulated in 1.5-2% alginate and
      coated with 0.4% chitosan. Furthermore, viability increased significantly in SIF 
      compared to the probiotic encapsulated in 1% alginate and coated with 0.4%
      chitosan and the non-encapsulated probiotic. Longer storage time and adverse
      conditions affected probiotics' survival, which was improved by the encapsulation
      with significantly higher viability than the non-encapsulated probiotic at
      different temperatures and storage duration. Encapsulation of B. subtilis E20 and
      dietary administration at 10(7) CFU kg(-1) decreased shrimp mortality after a
      Vibrio infection, thereby improving shrimp's disease resistance, while the
      non-encapsulated probiotic required 10(9) CFU kg(-1) to achieve better
      resistance. Although the best results of growth performance, immune response, and
      disease resistance against Vibrio alginolyticus were found in the shrimp fed with
      the diets supplemented with encapsulated probiotic at >10(8) CFU kg(-1), shrimp's
      growth performance and health status improved after being fed 10(7) CFU kg(-1)
      encapsulated probiotic for 56 days. Together, the results of this study prove
      that encapsulation could improve the viability of probiotic in different
      gastrointestinal conditions and adverse storage temperatures. Overall, lower
      concentrations of encapsulated probiotic B. subtilis E20 (10(7) CFU kg(-1)) was
      able to increase the growth performance and health status of shrimp.

AB  - Temperature serves as an important environmental factor in ecosystems.
      Understanding the cooperation of various tissues of animals in response to heat
      stress is the basis for clarifying the regulation mechanism of different species 
      under heat stress. Herein, a comparative transcriptomic analysis was conducted on
      three tissues (hepatopancreas, gill and muscle) of the Pacific white shrimp
      Litopenaeus vannamei under heat stress. Three tissues displayed distinct gene
      expression patterns, suggesting a cooperation based on division of labor might
      have occurred among them. In hepatopancreas and gill, genes related to ATP
      generation and utilization were down-regulated, and energetically expensive
      protein turnover was almost shut down. While in muscle, genes related to ATP
      generation and utilization, and those involved in several energy-consuming
      processes were up-regulated. In consistent, significant accumulation of ATP and
      decrease of total protein concentration were detected in hepatopancreas and gill,
      while it was opposite in muscle. Therefore, we suggest that different tissues may
      cooperate with each other simultaneously via energy reallocation in response to
      heat stress. Less energy was channeled into protein turnover in gill and
      hepatopancreas, and more energy was required for muscle. This study not only
      provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanism of L. vannamei 
      in response to high temperature, but also lays the foundation of mining
      thermotolerance genes and proposing effective strategies to cope with the high
      temperature environment.

AB  - Quartz crystal microbalances (QCMs) have been widely used in the food industry,
      environmental monitoring, and biomedicine. Here, a molecularly imprinted QCM
      sensor was prepared and used for formaldehyde detection. Using polyvinyl chloride
      as the embedding material and tetrahydrofuran as the solvent, a QCM electrode was
      modified with HCHO molecularly imprinted polymers (HCHO-MIPs). The detection
      conditions of the sensor were optimized, and its selectivity was investigated.
      The theoretical calculation results revealed that the acrylamide and
      pentaerythritol triacrylate were potential candidate functional monomer and
      cross-linking agent, respectively, in the preparation of HCHO-MIPs with high
      adsorbability, superselectivity, and stability. According to the calculated
      results, a sensor had been prepared. When the pH was 7, the added mass of the
      HCHO-MIPs (or NIPs) was 20 mg, and the amount of PVC coating was 20 muL, the
      sensor exhibited good adsorption, selectivity, repeatability, high sensitivity,
      high accuracy, and a short response time. The lowest detection limit was 10.72 ng
      mL(-1). The sensor exhibited higher selectivity for HCHO than for propionaldehyde
      and benzaldehyde. The HCHO contents in fresh shrimp samples were detected using
      the sensor for four cycles, and the detection rates were in the range of
      97.56-98.60%. This study provided a theoretical and experimental basis for the
      rapid detection of HCHO.

TI  - Subterranean carbon flows from source to stygofauna: a case study on the atyid

AB  - Groundwater biota are crucial for the ecological functioning of subterranean
      ecosystems. However, while knowledge of the taxonomic diversity of groundwater
      invertebrates (stygofauna) is increasing, functional ecological information is
      still limited. Here, we investigate seldom empirically tested assumptions around 
      stygofaunal trophic plasticity in coping with oligotrophic habitats. We focus on 
      Barrow Island (Western Australia), an ideal natural laboratory due to the
      occurrence of natural oil seeps in association with aquifers. The trophic
      position and food source use of the endemic atyid shrimp Stygiocaris stylifera
      (Holthuis, 1960) were assessed via delta(13)C and delta(15)N stable isotope
      analysis (SIA). Background information on the environmental conditions was
      gathered through hydrochemical data and delta(13)C SIA combined with (14)C data
      from dissolved inorganic/organic carbon and particulate organic carbon from
      groundwater samples. Our results indicate carbon enrichment in proximity to the
      natural oil seepage coupled with changes in trophic positions of S. stylifera
      from higher consumers/predators to biofilm grazers/decomposers. These results are
      consistent with an increased involvement of hydrocarbon seeps and associated
      microbial communities in the carbon flows and confirm potential for the trophic
      flexibility in stygofauna. Further investigations involving other trophic groups 
      will help elucidate the functioning of the ecosystems at a community level.

TI  - Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei real-time and Shrimp MultiPathTM PCR assay validation
      for South-East Asian and Latin American strains of Penaeid shrimp.
PG  - 11-23

AB  - Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP) infections are a global challenge for the
      Penaeid shrimp industry with a sharp rise in prevalence over the last 10 yr. EHP 
      is known to cause sub-optimal growth, large size variation and reduced survival
      of shrimp. Molecular methods development has mainly focussed on 18S rRNA or spore
      wall protein 1 (SWP1). Due to the specificity and sensitivity issues with
      previously designed assays for both targets, new molecular assays are needed by
      the global shrimp industry and regulators to help manage the risks posed by EHP. 
      This paper describes new real-time PCR (qPCR) methods developed for the novel EHP
      gene targets polar tube protein 2 (PTP2) and spore wall protein 26 (SWP26),
      whilst also presenting performance metrics of the new Shrimp MultiPathTM
      technology EHP assay. qPCR assays PTP2G and SWP26G show high amplification
      efficiency, a limit of detection (LOD) of between 1 and 4 copies, low assay
      variation and high diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) and specificity (DSp) compared to
      imperfect reference assays. Similar performance is seen with Shrimp MultiPathTM
      EHP showing an LOD of 8 copies, low assay variation and high DSe and DSp. These
      novel molecular targets for EHP and Shrimp MultiPathTM EHP strengthen global
      efforts to monitor and mitigate risks of EHP infections and outbreaks. Moreover, 
      this study presents novel data on distribution of EHP in shrimp populations from 
      South-East Asia and Latin America, and how sequence variations need to be
      considered when monitoring EHP in different geographies.

AB  - Cold plasma has potential for the degradation of aflatoxins in corn and
      hazelnuts; however, this has not been demonstrated for aflatoxin in milk. In this
      study, the efficacy of high voltage atmospheric cold plasma (HVACP) on the
      reduction of aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) in skim milk improved with increasing treatment 
      times (1-20 min), using gas containing 65% oxygen (MA65) rather than air,
      increasing voltage (60-80 kV) and reducing sample volume (30 mL-10 mL). Direct
      treatment was more effective than indirect treatment. AFM1 in milk was degraded
      by 65.0 % and 78.9 % by air and MA65 respectively in 20 min with no change in
      milk colour. The toxicity of AFM1 after treatment was assessed using a brine
      shrimp model. A five-minute HVACP treatment reduced the toxicity of AFM1 by 83.9 
      % based on the increase in brine shrimp survival. HVACP is a promising method to 
      reduce AFM1 in milk.

TI  - Recycling phosphorus and calcium from aquaculture waste as a precursor for
      hydroxyapatite (HAp) production: a review.
PG  - 46471-46486
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-20521-6 [doi]
AB  - Water contaminated with phosphorus needs to be managed efficiently to ensure that
      clean water sources will be preserved. Aquaculture plays an essential role in
      supplying food and generating high revenue. However, the quantity of phosphorus
      released from aquaculture effluents is among the major concerns for the
      environment. Phosphorus is a non-renewable, spatially concentrated material
      essential for global food production. Phosphorus is also known as a primary
      source of eutrophication. Hence, phosphorus recovery and separation from
      different wastewater streams are mandatory. This paper reviews the source of
      phosphorus in the environment, focusing on aquaculture wastewater as a precursor 
      for hydroxyapatite formation evaluates the research progress on maximizing
      phosphorus removal from aquaculture wastewater effluents and converting it into a
      conversion. Shrimp shell waste appears to be an essential resource for
      manufacturing high-value chemicals, given current trends in wealth creation from 
      waste. Shrimp shell waste is the richest source of calcium carbonate and has been
      used to produce hydroxyapatite after proper treatment is reviewed. There have
      been significant attempts to create safe and long-term solutions for the disposal
      of shrimp shell debris. Through the discussion, the optimum condition of the
      method, the source of phosphorus, and the calcium are the factors that influence 
      the formation of hydroxyapatite as a pioneer in zero-waste management for
      sustainability and profitable approach. This review will provide comprehensive
      documentation on resource utilization and product development from aquaculture
      wastewater and waste to achieve a zero-waste approach.

AB  - Foodborne diseases have become a serious havoc, where antimicrobial resistance is
      throwing significant challenges on daily basis. With the increase of
      drug-resistant bacteria and food-borne infection associated with Vibrio
      parahaemolyticus, new and effective strategies were needed to control the
      emergence of vibriosis. Lytic bacteriophages come up as a promising way to resist
      the pathogenic population in various applications. In this study, a V.
      parahaemolyticus specific phage vB_VpS_PG28 was isolated from sewage in the
      seafood market. Results showed vB_VpS_PG28, is strictly a lytic bacteriophage and
      has a relatively large burst size of 103 plaque-forming units per infected cell. 
      Comparative genomic and bioinformatic analyses proved that vB_VpS_PG28 is a new
      bacteriophage that had a homologous relation with Vibrio phages of family
      Siphoviridae, especially with phage VH2_2019, but transmission electron
      microscopy of vB_VpS_PG28 morphology characterized its morphology is similar to
      that of Myoviridae family. In silico analysis indicated that the vB_VpS_PG28
      genome consists of 82712 bp (48.08% GC content) encoding 114 putative ORFs
      without tRNA,and any gene associated with resistance or virulence factors has not
      been found. The bacteriophage in the present study has shown significant outcomes
      in order to control bacterial growth under in vitro conditions. Thus, we are
      suggesting a beneficiary agent against foodborne pathogens. Further, to ensure
      the safe usage of phage oral toxicity testing is recommended.

AB  - The lipase gene from Psychrobacter celer PU3 was cloned into pET-28a(+)
      expression vector and overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells. The
      purified Psychrobacter celer lipase (PCL) was characterized as an alkaline active
      enzyme and has a molecular mass of around 30 kDa. The PCL was active even at a
      low temperature and the optimum range was observed between 10 and 40 degrees C
      temperatures. MALDI-TOF and phylogenetic analysis ensured that Psychrobacter
      celer PU3 lipase (PCL) was closely related to P. aureginosa lipase (PAL). MD
      simulation results suggest that temperature change did not affect the overall
      structure of PCL, but it might altered the temperature-dependent PCL functional
      changes. R1 (129-135 AA) and R2 (187-191 AA) regions could be important for
      temperature-dependent PCL function and they fluctuated much at 35 degrees C
      temperature. PMSF completely inhibited PCL lipase activity and it demonstrates
      the presence of serine residues in the active site of PCL. PCL is moderately
      halophilic and most of the tested organic solvents found to be inhibiting the
      lipase activity except the solvents ethanol and methanol. PCL activity was
      increased with surfactants (SDS and CTAB) and bleaching agents (hydrogen
      peroxide). The effect of different metal ions on PCL resulted that only mercuric 
      chloride was found as the enhancer of the lipase activity. Antibiofilm property
      of PCL was evaluated against pathogenic Vibrio parahaemolyticus isolated from the
      diseased shrimp and MIC value was 500 U. PCL significantly altered the morphology
      and biofilm density of V. parahaemolyticus and the same was observed through
      scanning electron microscope (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) 
      imaging. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the mRNA expression level of biofilm,
      colony morphology and major toxin-related (aphA, luxS, opaR, tolC, toxR) genes of
      V. parahaemolyticus were significantly downregulated with PCL treatment.

      antioxidant and anticancer activities.

AB  - Thiosemicarbazides (TSCs), dithiocarbamates (DTCs) and their molecular conjugates
      are promising drug targets. However, hybrids of DTCs with TSCs themselves are
      rarely investigated. Thus, studies were initiated to synthesize novel system
      derived from TSC-DTCs to examine their pharmacological applications. The targeted
      conjugates were designed and synthesized from aryl TSC and aryl DTCs in moderate 
      to good yields. The structures of synthesized compounds were confirmed through
      FT-IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and mass spectrometry. The conjugates have been tested
      for antioxidant and anticancer activities. The in vitro antioxidant activity was 
      performed using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging
      assay, hydrogen peroxide scavenging assay and nitric oxide assay and was also
      compared with aryl DTCs and aryl TSCs to explore potential of newly synthesized
      hybrids. The preliminary anticancer screening for cytotoxicity was performed
      using brine shrimp lethality bioassay using Artemia salina shrimps. Anticancer
      screening was determined against NCI60 human tumor cell lines at NCI, USA. The
      results revealed that, newly synthesized hybrids are more active as compared to
      aryl DTCs and aryl TSCs. Among the tested conjugates for antioxidant screening,
      3b was found to be more active than the standard ascorbic acid. The IC50 value of
      3b were 8.96 +/- 0.089, 10.7 +/- 0.016 and 12.29 +/- 0.086 mug/ml for DPPH,
      hydrogen peroxide scavenging assay and nitric oxide assay respectively, whereas
      IC50 values for standard were 11.75 +/- 0.015, 12.03 +/- 0.107 and 16.66 +/-
      0.242 mug/ml respectively. Since hybrids are more active than aryl DTCs and aryl 
      TSCs, only newly synthesized hybrids were screened for anticancer potential. For 
      cytotoxicity screening, compound 3b was found to be most active among synthesized
      conjugates with LD50 value of 33.86 mug/ml. For anticancer screening, the
      compounds 3c and 3d were found to be potent among synthesized series with percent
      growth inhibition of 22 to 44% when screened against colon cancer cell lines
      whereas, compound 3b showed growth inhibition of 40% for selective leukemia cell 
      line, K-562. The compounds 3b, 3c and 3d with strong electron-withdrawing groups 
      were found to be the most active antioxidant and anticancer agents among the
      synthesized conjugates.

AB  - Plant-based protein concentrate (PC) was extracted from under-utilized corn
      distillers solubles comprising a distinctive heat-treated blend of corn and yeast
      proteins. Enzymolysis of PC with alcalase generated protein hydrolysate (PH)
      containing angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides. A novel
      kinetic model is developed to elucidate enzymolysis kinetics of PC. The PH of
      greatest DH ( approximately 25%) revealed maximum ACE inhibition (%).
      Fractionated PH (<3 kDa) had non-toxic and non-allergenic unique peptides
      encrypted with anti-ACE fragments. Promising bioactive peptides (PeptideRanker > 
      0.85) docked with ACE had free energies between -8.40 and -10.60 kcal.mol(-1)
      greater than captopril (-6.34 kcal.mol(-1)). The yeast-derived RLLPF peptide
      interacted with all active pockets of ACE (S1, S2, S') via hydrogen-, polar- and 
      hydrophobic-bonds. Docking results suggested that ARG(522), VAL(518), TRP(357),
      TYR(523), GLU(384), ALA(356), ARG(124), HIS(387), HIS(410), ASN(66), and ALA(354)
      of ACE aided in stabilizing complexes with peptides. Thus, PH could be used as
      antihypertensive ingredient for feed, food, or pharmaceutical industries.

AB  - Plants have a pivotal role in ethnopharmacology, and their preparations are in
      use globally. However, getting down to the structure requires an effective
      workflow and mostly requires a time-consuming isolation process. Although
      bioassay-guided approaches are widely popular, they face a massive problem of
      rediscovery in recent times, especially in plant metabolomics. Mass spectrometry 
      (MS)-based approach incorporated molecular networking via Global Natural Product 
      Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) is considered here for the benefit of the fast
      screening of secondary metabolites. This study uses direct crude extracts
      obtained from various parts of the Urtica dioica plant for the characterization
      of secondary metabolites. The crude extract of the plant initially displayed
      promising antioxidant and anti-diabetic activities. Then, we employed mass
      spectrometry-based dereplication to identify the phytochemical components in the 
      extracts. This led to the discovery of 7 unknown and 17 known secondary
      metabolites, which were further verified with the SIRIUS 4 platform, a
      computational tool for the annotation of compounds using tandem MS data. On the
      other hand, chasing the antioxidant activity of methanolic extract of U. dioica
      leaves, we employed a bioassay-guided isolation approach. With this method, we
      isolated and characterized compound 13, a known molecule, which possessed strong 
      antioxidant activity without showing much toxicity in the brine shrimp lethality 
      test at the test concentration of 1 mg/mL. With our results, we advocate the
      MS-based approach as a good starting point for the dereplication of compounds
      from the complex crude extracts of plants.

AB  - Chitosan is a biostimulator that has a great effect either on plant physiology,
      productivity, or fruit quality. However, the metabolic mechanism regulated by
      chitosan still remains unknown. Untargeted metabolomics analysis, using LC-MS/MS 
      mass spectrometry, was used to investigate fruit quality markers. Thus, this
      study was focused on the identification of untargeted metabolites of tomato
      fruits produced under the application of five doses of chitosan at different
      concentrations (0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1 mg ml(-1)) that was extracted from
      Parapenaeus longirostris shrimp shells. The identification was carried out using 
      two ion modes (ESI(-)/ESI(+)), a web application "Metfamily" to analyze signals, 
      and reference libraries. The analysis of data using partial least squares
      discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) showed
      that chitosan application, especially 0.75 mg ml(-1), had a clear and remarkable 
      effect regarding the number of metabolite families identified in both ion modes. 
      This treatment has increased the relative abundance of many metabolites that
      belong to anthocyanins decorated with sugars, terpenoids, phenylpropanoids,
      acylsugars, glucosinolates, folates, galactolipids, fatty acids, and
      phospholipids. Thus, these results showed that chitosan application increased the
      quality of tomato fruits due to its involvement in the regulation of many
      metabolic pathways that might be responsible for enhancing the nutritional
      characteristics as well as the defense of fruits.

TI  - Influences of Thermal Stress During Three Weeks Before Market Age on Histology
      and Expression of Genes Associated With Adipose Infiltration and Inflammation in

AB  - The objectives of this study were to examine the effects of cyclic thermal stress
      on histological characteristics of breast muscle and gene expression regarding
      adipose infiltration and inflammation in breast muscles collected from different 
      breeds of chickens. The birds, from commercial broilers (CB, Ross 308, 3 weeks), 
      native (NT, 100% Thai native Chee, 9 weeks), H75 (crossbred; 75% broiler and 25% 
      NT, 5 weeks), and H50 (crossbred; 50% broiler and 50% NT, 7 weeks), were equally 
      assigned into control or treatment groups. The control samples were reared under 
      a constant temperature of 26 +/- 1 degrees C, while the treatment groups were
      exposed to 35 +/- 1 degrees C (6 h per day). After a 20-day thermal challenge, 12
      male birds per treatment group were randomly collected for determination of live 
      body weight, breast weight, numbers of growth-related myopathies, and breast meat
      chemical composition. Histological lesions were evaluated in the pectoralis major
      muscle immediately collected within 20 min postmortem based on hematoxylin and
      eosin staining. The results indicated that despite interaction between thermal
      stress and breed effects, thermal challenge significantly reduced feed intake,
      live body weight, and breast weight of the birds and increased moisture content
      in breast meat (p < 0.05). An interaction between the two main factors was found 
      for protein content (p < 0.05) for which control CB showed less protein than the 
      other groups. Heat stress decreased histological scores for adipose infiltration 
      in CB (p < 0.05), but it did not significantly influence such scores in the other
      groups. CB received histological scores for adipose tissue at greater extent than
      those for the other groups. Differential absolute abundance of CD36, FABP4,
      LITAF, PDGFRA, PLIN1, PPARG, POSTN, SCD1, and TGFB1 in the muscle samples
      well-agreed with the trend of histological scores, suggesting potential
      involvement of dysregulated fibro-adipogenic progenitors together with imbalanced
      lipid storage and utilization in the breast muscle. The findings demonstrated
      that the cyclic thermal challenge restricted growth performance and breast mass
      of the birds, but such effects attenuated infiltration of adipose tissue and
      inflammatory cells in the CB breast muscle.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is the most known complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM). Aerobic exercise improves glycemic control in T2DM, although the
      underlying mechanisms of comorbid depression-like behaviors in T2DM have not yet 
      been fully elucidated. METHODS: 120 zebrafish were randomly assigned to four
      groups: Control, T2DM, T2DM + metformin, and T2DM + aerobic exercise. Then, all
      animals except the control group were fed with high glucose fairy shrimp (~40
      g/kg/day) and exposed reserpine (40 mug/ml for 20 min) for 10 days. Here,
      behavioral tests were used for model verification. Following the verification,
      all groups were treated as before. Additionally, the T2DM + metformin group
      received metformin (~10.6 mg/kg/day) at the same time, while the T2DM + aerobic
      exercise group received aerobic exercise 30 min/day. Finally, blood glucose and
      behavioral tests, as well as protein and molecular levels were determined at Day 
      11 and 12. RESULTS: Aerobic exercise alleviated depressive-like behavior and
      enhanced the levels of antidepressant biomarkers (NE, 5-HIAA) in zebrafish after 
      10 consecutive days of exercise. Additionally, 10 consecutive days of aerobic
      exercise decreased the levels of inflammatory biomarkers (IFN-gamma, IL-1, IL-4) 
      and depressive biomarkers (cortisol). Meanwhile, it also aided in the reduction
      of CD11b, IL-6, IL-6R, and caspase-3 expression to combat the neuroinflammation
      induced by T2DM, mediated the BDNF-TrkB pathway, and increased Bcl-2/Bax levels. 
      CONCLUSION: Given the remarkable similarity in neurochemistry between humans and 
      zebrafish, this study supports the effectiveness of aerobic exercise as clinical 
      guidance in preventing and treating T2DM complicated with depression.

AB  - The aims of the present research were to evaluate the health risk of long-term
      exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) concerning the human,
      ecotoxicological risk for marine biota, and identify their possible sources.
      Surface sediment bioassay samples were collected from 15 stations of tourist
      beaches surrounding Bushehr City and analyzed using high performance liquid
      chromatography (HPLC). The results indicated the concentrations of summation
      operatorPAH ranged from 193.5 to 725.5 ng g(-1) with mean value of 351.1 +/-
      155.2 ng g(-1), which could be considered as moderate level of pollution.
      Measured levels of PAH in sediments were compared with sediment quality
      guidelines (SQGs), indicating low to medium ecotoxicological risk on marine
      organisms. Moreover, mean ERM quotient (M-ERM-Q) and mean PEL quotient (M-PEL-Q) 
      were implemented, demonstrating potentially biological adverse effects. A
      preliminary evaluation of human health risk using incremental lifetime cancer
      risk (ILCR) and toxic equivalent quotient (TEQ(carc)) indicated that
      PAH-contaminated sediment in some stations of touristic beaches of Bushehr City
      would induce potential carcinogenic effects especially for children. Composition 
      and diagnostic analysis indicated that PAHs originated from both pyrogenic and
      petrogenic, with higher portion of incomplete combustion PAHs.

AB  - Due to the ubiquity of microplastic contamination in coastal waters, there is
      potential for adverse impacts to organism development. One organism of interest
      is the daggerblade grass shrimp, Palaemon pugio, an ecologically important
      species in estuaries along the east coast of North America. We exposed larval
      grass shrimp to virgin polyethylene microbeads (35 and 58 microm) at a high
      (0.375 and 1.95 mg/L), medium (0.0375 and 0.195 mg/L), and a low concentration
      (0.00375 and 0.0195 mg/L), respectively for 23 days to assess mortality,
      transformation time from larval to juvenile stage, and weight. Average percent
      mortality was 3.7 to 4.8 times higher in the experimental treatments compared to 
      controls. The greatest proportion of mortality was observed in the first 11 days.
      Median time for transformation ranged from 20.2 to 20.8 days. Shrimp exposed to
      the 35 microm beads in the high treatment (20.2 days) transformed significantly
      faster than the control shrimp (20.8 days). Although development was not delayed 
      and size of the shrimp did not differ, the acute toxicity of microplastics on
      grass shrimp is a concern due to their role in energy cycling within
      tidal-creeks. These findings suggest potential population and community level
      effects following microplastic exposure.

      using ethyl acetate and water as solvents. The cholesterol incorporating beta-CD 
      complex (beta-CD-CL) was collected and beta-CD recovery was performed using a
      beta-CD-CL : ethanol mixture (1 : 15 ratio) with the aid of ultrasonication and a
      water bath at 55 degrees C for 40 min. Recycled beta-CD (R-beta-CD) was compared 
      with pure beta-CD (P-beta-CD) for the reusability of cholesterol removal from
      shrimp lipid. R-beta-CD showed 94% cholesterol removal, while 95% was achieved
      for P-beta-CD. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) showed a slight decrease
      in the melting point of R-beta-CD. Nevertheless, FTIR and NMR results revealed
      that functional groups and the proton spectrum of R-beta-CD was negligibly
      altered. Fatty acid contents of treated oil were slightly higher when treated
      with R-beta-CD than those of the lipid subjected to P-beta-CD treatment.
      Reusability of beta-CD could be achieved as confirmed by the maintained capacity 
      in cholesterol removal and unaltered structure.

TI  - Food Intake and Diet Quality of Pregnant Women in China During the COVID-19
      Pandemic: A National Cross-Sectional Study.
PG  - 853565

AB  - Background: Between January and April 2020, China implemented differentiated
      prevention and control strategies across the country, based on the severity of
      the COVID-19 epidemic/pandemic in different regions. These strategies included
      lockdowns, social distancing, and the closure of public places. These measures
      may have affected dietary intake to varying degrees. This study aimed to assess
      variations in food intake and diet quality among pregnant women according to
      regional severity and related control measures during the most severe period of
      COVID-19 restrictions in 2020. Methods: A total of 3,678 pregnant women from 19
      provinces/municipalities in mainland China were analyzed in this nationwide,
      multi-center study. Food intake data were obtained and assessed using a validated
      food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Diet quality was quantified using the Diet
      Balance Index for Pregnancy (DBI-P), which included high bound score (HBS,
      excessive dietary intake), low bound score (LBS, insufficient dietary intake),
      and diet quality distance (DQD, dietary imbalance). Linear trend tests and
      multivariable regression analyses were performed to examine the association
      between food intake, DBI-P and the severity of pandemic. Results: The median
      daily intake of vegetables, fruit, livestock/poultry meat, dairy, and nuts
      decreased (p < 0.05) according to low, moderate, and high severity of the
      pandemic, while no significant differences in cereals/potatoes, eggs, and
      fish/shrimp intake. The median daily intake of cereals/potatoes exceeded the
      recommended ranges, and the daily intake of eggs and fish/shrimp was below
      recommended ranges regardless of the pandemic severity (p < 0.05). Regarding diet
      quality, HBS decreased (lower excessive consumption) (p = 0.047) and LBS
      increased (greater insufficient consumption) (p = 0.046) with increased severity 
      of the pandemic. On multivariable analyses, moderate and high pandemic severity
      were related to lower HBS risk (OR = 0.687, OR = 0.537) and higher LBS risk (beta
      = 1.517, beta = 3.020) when compared to low pandemic severity. Conclusions: Under
      more severe COVID-19 pandemic conditions, pregnant women consumed less quality
      food, characterized by reduced consumption of vegetables, fruit,
      livestock/poultry meat, dairy and nuts, while the quality of the foods that
      pregnant women consumed in excess tended to improve, but the overconsumption of
      cereals/potatoes was a problem.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of In Vitro Enzyme Inhibitory Activities and Phytochemicals 
      from Platycladus orientalis (L.) Franco via Solvent Partitioning Method.

AB  - The extraction of plant bioactive compounds from Platycladus orientalis (L.)
      Franco remains a great challenge due to the different chemical groups. This study
      aimed to compare the bioactive compounds with enzyme inhibitory effect from P.
      orientalis via solvent partitioning method. Dried leaf samples were macerated and
      fractionated with six solvents of different polarities. The phenolic, flavonoid, 
      tannin, saponin, alkaloid and pharmacological activities including
      anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, antioxidant and anti-glycation potential were
      compared across the six plant fractions. Toxicity assessment was performed with
      an in vivo brine shrimp model. The varying levels of bioactive compounds in ethyl
      acetate (phenolics, flavonoids), hexane (saponins, tannins) and chloroform
      (alkaloids) fractions clearly demonstrated the significant impact of solvent
      polarity on the extraction of bioactive compounds. The reducing potential (r =
      0.67), IC50 of alpha-amylase inhibition (r = -0.71), IC50 of advanced glycation
      end-product inhibition (r = -0.93) and dicarbonyl compound inhibition (r = 0.57) 
      in the plant fractions were correlated (p<0.05) with the flavonoids. Besides, the
      alkaloid, saponin and tannin were associated with cyclooxygenase-1 inhibitory
      activity. Principal component analysis confirmed that solvent polarity (23.9%)
      and plant extraction yield (37.1%) collectively contributed to 61% of bioactivity
      variation in P. orientalis. Among the six plant fractions, ethyl acetate fraction
      exhibited relatively high anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, antioxidant and
      anti-glycation potential while the non-toxic methanolic and aqueous fractions
      displayed optimal hyaluronidase and lipoxygenase inhibitory activities,
      respectively. The current study has identified semi-polar ethyl acetate fraction 
      of P. orientalis as a good alternative source of bioactive compounds for future
      pharmaceutical product development.

      atrazine.
LID - 10.1007/s00128-022-03526-2 [doi]
AB  - The toxicity of pesticides to non-target organisms continues to be important in
      understanding the dynamic interactions between anthropogenic chemicals and
      ecosystem health. This study assesses biochemical markers to determine the
      effects that varying concentrations of atrazine (13.1-5557 microg/l) have on the 
      freshwater shrimp, Caridina africana. Exposure and oxidative stress biomarkers
      were analysed and followed by univariate, integrated biomarker response v2
      (IBRv2) and Kendall Tau correlation statistical analyses, to gain insight into
      the concentration-dependent responses. Oxidative stress biomarkers such as
      reduced glutathione content (GSH), glutathione-S-transferase activity (GST),
      superoxide dismutase activity (SOD) and catalase activity (CAT) were
      significantly correlated with increasing atrazine exposure concentration (p <
      0.01). Bimodality has been seen when looking at both the univariate statistically
      significant differences as well as the IBRv2, with the first peak at 106.8
      microg/l and the second peak at 5557 microg/l atrazine. The results indicate that
      while individual responses may indicate statistically significant differences,
      using correlation and integrated statistical analysis can shed light on trends in
      the adaptive response of these.

TI  - The SIEA SHRIMP Flap: An Ultrathin Axial Pattern Free Flap Useable in Obese
      Patients.
PG  - e4274
LID - 10.1097/GOX.0000000000004274 [doi]
AB  - The reconstruction of distal extremity wounds poses a unique surgical challenge. 
      In free tissue transfer, a thin, pliable skin flap is the ideal. Obese patients
      have a paucity of thin skin donor sites. Herein we report the discovery of a free
      SHRIMP flap (Superthin Harvest of a Reliable Islanded Medial Pannus flap) based
      on the SIEA vessels, harvested from a thick abdominal pannus at the time of
      cosmetic abdominoplasty. A 61-year-old woman with a chronic wound of the right
      Achilles tendon was evaluated for reconstruction after failing conservative
      measures. At the time of consultation, the patient expressed interest in
      abdominoplasty. Therefore, a skin flap from the abdomen or rectus abdominis
      muscle flap in the context of an abdominoplasty was offered. Despite obesity
      affecting the pannus, the superficial inferior epigastric vessels were found to
      course superficially beneath the dermis at time of abdominoplasty. This allowed
      straightforward harvest of a superthin flap of skin and minimal subcutaneous fat,
      which contoured to the ankle with an aesthetically pleasing outcome. The patient 
      was satisfied with the results of her abdominoplasty and coverage of her chronic 
      wound. The SHRIMP flap provides a straightforward, axial pattern, superthin free 
      skin flap based on the superficial inferior epigastric vessels, and represents a 
      useful option in obese patients. The flap can be combined with abdominoplasty for
      an aesthetic donor site.

AB  - In this work, we proposed a rapid and easy check of the drinking water pollution 
      level due to bacteria growth by semiconductor gas sensor. Highly sensitive
      vertical channel organic ammonia gas sensor was used to detect the gases emitted 
      from the polluted water, and then determined effective ammonia concentration
      according to its response. Residues from meat of fish, shrimp, and fruits were
      mashed and added to the clean water. The water samples were stored at 35 degrees 
      C for natural decay. Initially the bacteria concentration was below 100 colony
      forming unit per ml (cfu/ml), then it increased to10(3) cfu/ml in 2 h and 10(5)
      cfu/ml in 4 h, which was beyond the drinking safety standard, 500 cfu/ml. At this
      gas level no bad odor can be sensed by human yet, however, the effective ammonia 
      concentration of those samples rises to 300-500 ppb in 2 h. The amine gas sensor 
      can therefore be used as a rapid check if the bacteria level inside the water is 
      far over the safety standard.

AB  - In aquatic arthropods, molting is a pivotal physiological process for normal
      development, but it may also expose them to higher risks from xenobiotics,
      because the organism may take up additional water during that time. This study
      aimed to assess the effects of molting on bioconcentration and survival after
      96-h exposure to insecticide fipronil with or without oxygenase (CYP450s)
      inhibitor piperonyl butoxide (PBO) of two estuarine resident marine crustacean
      species: the sand shrimp Crangon uritai and the kuruma prawn Penaeus japonicus,
      with 96-h LC50 value of fipronil = 2.0 microg/L and 0.2 microg/L, respectively.
      Two graded concentrations included group high (H) (equivalent to the 96-h LC50
      values) and low (L) (one-tenth of the H group concentration). Molting and
      survival were individually checked, and internal concentrations of fipronil and
      its metabolites (fipronil desulfinyl, fipronil sulfide, fipronil sulfone) were
      measured. The results showed that, only fipronil and fipronil sulfone were
      detected from organism, and that internal concentrations of these insecticides in
      molted specimens were higher than those of unmolted ones but comparable with
      those of dead ones. Accordingly, mortality was more frequent in molted specimens 
      than those that were unmolted. Furthermore, involvement of oxygenase and higher
      lethal body burden threshold may confer higher tolerance to fipronil in sand
      shrimp than in the kuruma prawn. This study is the first to demonstrate that the 
      body-residue-based approach is useful for deciphering the causal factors
      underlying fipronil toxicity, but highlights the need to consider physiological
      factors in arthropods, which influence and lie beyond body burden, molting and
      drug metabolism.

      diseases relationship.
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.16024 [doi]
AB  - Intensive case study has established dysbiosis in the gut microbiota-shrimp
      disease relationship; however, variability in experimental design and the
      diversity of diseases arise the question of whether some gut indicators are
      robust and universal in response to shrimp health status, irrespective of causal 
      agents. Through an unbiased subject-level meta-analysis framework, we re-analysed
      10 studies, including 261 samples, four lifestages and six different diseases
      (the causal agents are virus, bacterial, eukaryotic pathogens, or unknown).
      Results showed that shrimp diseases reproducibly altered the structure of gut
      bacterial community, but not diversity. After ruling out the lifestage- and
      disease specific- discriminatory taxa (different diseases dependent indicators), 
      we identify 18 common disease-discriminatory taxa (indicative of health status,
      irrespective of causal agents) that accurately diagnosed (90.0% accuracy) shrimp 
      health status, regardless of different diseases. These optimizations
      substantially improved the performance (62.6% vs. 90.0%) diagnosing model. The
      robustness and universality of model were validated for effectiveness via
      leave-one-dataset-out validation and independent cohorts. Interspecies
      interaction and stability of the gut microbiotas were consistently compromised in
      diseased shrimp compared with corresponding healthy cohorts, while stochasticity 
      and beta-dispersion exhibited the opposite trend. Collectively, our findings
      exemplify the utility of microbiome meta-analyses in identifying robust and
      reproducible features for quantitatively diagnosing disease incidence, and the
      downstream consequences for shrimp pathogenesis from an ecological prospective.

TI  - Seafood Discards: A Potent Source of Enzymes and Biomacromolecules With
      Nutritional and Nutraceutical Significance.
PG  - 879929
LID - 10.3389/fnut.2022.879929 [doi]
AB  - In recent times, the seafood industry is found to produce large volumes of waste 
      products comprising shrimp shells, fish bones, fins, skins, intestines, and
      carcasses, along with the voluminous quantity of wastewater effluents. These
      seafood industry effluents contain large quantities of lipids, amino acids,
      proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids, minerals, and carotenoids mixed with the
      garbage. This debris not only causes a huge wastage of various nutrients but also
      roots in severe environmental contamination. Hence, the problem of such seafood
      industry run-offs needs to be immediately managed with a commercial outlook.
      Microbiological treatment may lead to the valorization of seafood wastes, the
      trove of several useful compounds into value-added materials like enzymes, such
      as lipase, protease, chitinase, hyaluronidase, phosphatase, etc., and organic
      compounds like bioactive peptides, collagen, gelatin, chitosan, and mineral-based
      nutraceuticals. Such bioconversion in combination with a bio-refinery strategy
      possesses the potential for environment-friendly and inexpensive management of
      discards generated from seafood, which can sustainably maintain the production of
      seafood. The compounds that are being produced may act as nutritional sources or 
      as nutraceuticals, foods with medicinal value. Determining utilization of seafood
      discard not only reduces the obnoxious deposition of waste but adds economy in
      the production of food with nutritional and medicinal importance, and, thereby
      meets up the long-lasting global demand of making nutrients and nutraceuticals
      available at a nominal cost.

TI  - Concentration and quantification of Tilapia tilapinevirus from water using a
      simple iron flocculation coupled with probe-based RT-qPCR.
PG  - e13157

AB  - Background: Tilapia tilapinevirus, also known as tilapia lake virus (TiLV), is a 
      significant virus that is responsible for the die-off of farmed tilapia across
      the globe. The detection and quantification of the virus using environmental RNA 
      (eRNA) from pond water samples represents a potentially non-invasive and routine 
      strategy for monitoring pathogens and early disease forecasting in aquaculture
      systems. Methods: Here, we report a simple iron flocculation method for
      concentrating viruses in water, together with a newly-developed hydrolysis probe 
      quantitative RT-qPCR method for the detection and quantification of TiLV.
      Results: The RT-qPCR method designed to target a conserved region of the TiLV
      genome segment 9 has a detection limit of 10 viral copies per microL of template.
      The method had a 100% analytical specificity and sensitivity for TiLV. The
      optimized iron flocculation method was able to recover 16.11 +/- 3.3% of the
      virus from water samples spiked with viral cultures. Tilapia and water samples
      were collected for use in the detection and quantification of TiLV disease during
      outbreaks in an open-caged river farming system and two earthen fish farms. TiLV 
      was detected from both clinically sick and asymptomatic fish. Most importantly,
      the virus was successfully detected from water samples collected from different
      locations in the affected farms (i.e., river water samples from affected cages
      (8.50 x 10(3) to 2.79 x 10(5) copies/L) and fish-rearing water samples, sewage,
      and reservoir (4.29 x 10(3) to 3.53 x 10(4) copies/L)). By contrast, TiLV was not
      detected in fish or water samples collected from two farms that had previously
      experienced TiLV outbreaks and from one farm that had never experienced a TiLV
      outbreak. In summary, this study suggests that the eRNA detection system using
      iron flocculation, coupled with probe based-RT-qPCR, is feasible for use in the
      concentration and quantification of TiLV from water. This approach may be useful 
      for the non-invasive monitoring of TiLV in tilapia aquaculture systems and may
      support evidence-based decisions on biosecurity interventions needed.

AB  - Marsupenaeus japonicus is an important marine crustacean species. However, a lack
      of genomic resources hinders the use of whole genome sequencing to explore their 
      genetic basis and molecular mechanisms for genome-assisted breeding.
      Consequently, we determined the chromosome-level genome of M. japonicus. Here we 
      determine the chromosome-level genome assembly for M. japonicus with a total of
      665.19 Gb genomic sequencing data, yielding an approximately1.54 Gb assembly with
      a contig N50 size of 229.97 kb and a scaffold N50 size of 38.27 Mb. With the
      high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) technology, we anchored
      18,019 contigs onto 42 pseudo-chromosomes, accounting for 99.40% of the total
      genome assembly. Analysis of the present M. japonicus genome revealed 24,317
      protein-coding genes and a high proportion of repetitive sequences (61.56%). The 
      high-quality genome assembly enabled the identification of genes associated with 
      cold-stress and cold tolerance in kuruma shrimp through the comparison of
      eyestalk transcriptomes between the low temperature-stressed shrimp (10 degrees
      C) and normal temperature shrimp (28 degrees C). The genome assembly presented
      here could be useful in future studies to reveal the molecular mechanisms of M.
      japonicus in response to low temperature stress and the molecular assisted
      breeding of M. japonicus in low temperature.

TI  - Silibinin and Naringenin against Bisphenol A-Induced Neurotoxicity in Zebrafish
      Model-Potential Flavonoid Molecules for New Drug Design, Development, and Therapy
      for Neurological Disorders.
LID - 2572 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27082572 [doi]
AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA), a well-known xenoestrogen, is commonly utilised in the
      production of polycarbonate plastics. Based on the existing evidence, BPA is
      known to induce neurotoxicity and behavioural issues. Flavonoids such as
      silibinin and naringenin have been shown to have biological activity against a
      variety of illnesses. The current research evaluates the neuropharmacological
      effects of silibinin and naringenin in a zebrafish model against neurotoxicity
      and oxidative stress caused by Bisphenol A. In this study, a novel tank diving
      test (NTDT) and light-dark preference test (LDPT) were used in neurobehavioural
      investigations. The experimental protocol was planned to last 21 days. The
      neuroprotective effects of silibinin (10 muM) and naringenin (10 muM) in
      zebrafish (Danio rerio) induced by BPA (17.52 muM) were investigated. In the
      brine shrimp lethality assay, the 50% fatal concentrations (LC50) were 34.10
      mug/mL (silibinin) and 91.33 mug/mL (naringenin) compared to the standard
      potassium dichromate (13.15 mug/mL). The acute toxicity investigation found no
      mortality or visible abnormalities in the silibinin- and naringenin-treated
      groups (LC50 &gt; 100 mg/L). The altered scototaxis behaviour in LDPT caused by
      BPA was reversed by co-supplementation with silibinin and naringenin, as shown by
      decreases in the number of transitions to the light zone and the duration spent
      in the light zone. Our findings point to BPA's neurotoxic potential in causing
      altered scototaxis and bottom-dwelling behaviour in zebrafish, as well as the
      usage of silibinin and naringenin as potential neuroprotectants.

TI  - Role of Cellular Receptors in the Innate Immune System of Crustaceans in Response
      to White Spot Syndrome Virus.
LID - 743 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14040743 [doi]
AB  - Innate immunity is the only defense system for resistance against infections in
      crustaceans. In crustaceans, white spot diseases caused by white spot syndrome
      virus (WSSV) are a serious viral disease with high accumulative mortality after
      infection. Attachment and entry into cells have been known to be two initial and 
      important steps in viral infection. However, systematic information about the
      mechanisms related to WSSV infection in crustaceans is still limited. Previous
      studies have reported that cellular receptors are important in the innate immune 
      system and are responsible for the recognition of foreign microorganisms and in
      the stimulation of the immune responses during infections. In this review, we
      summarize the current understanding of the functions of cellular receptors,
      including Toll, C-type lectin, scavenger receptor, beta-integrin, polymeric
      immunoglobulin receptor, laminin receptor, globular C1q receptor,
      lipopolysaccharide-and beta-1,3-glucan-binding protein, chitin-binding protein,
      Ras-associated binding, and Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule in the innate
      immune defense of crustaceans, especially shrimp and crabs, in response to WSSV
      infection. The results of this study provide information on the interaction
      between viruses and hosts during infections, which is important in the
      development of preventative strategies and antiviral targets in cultured aquatic 
      animals.

AB  - Shrimp aquaculture industry has steadily increased with demand and development of
      aquaculture technology. In recent years, frequent diseases have become a major
      risk factor for shrimp aquaculture, such as a drastically reduced the production 
      of shrimp and causing national economic loss. Among them, shrimp bacterial
      diseases such as hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) and necrotizing
      hepatopancreatitis (NHP-B) and parasitic disease such as Aphanomyces astaci
      (crayfish plague) are emerging and evolving into new types. OIE (World
      Organization for Animal Health) regularly updates information on diseases in the 
      Aquatic Code and Aquatic Manual, but in-depth information on the shrimp diseases 
      are lacking. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to provide information
      necessary for the response and prevention of shrimp diseases by understanding the
      characteristics and diagnosis of shrimp diseases designated by OIE.

TI  - New Insights into the Mechanism of Action of PirAB from Vibrio Parahaemolyticus.
LID - 243 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/toxins14040243 [doi]
AB  - PirAB toxins secreted by Vibrio parahaemolyticus (Vp) harbor the pVA1 virulence
      plasmid, which causes acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND), an
      emerging disease in Penaeid shrimp that can cause 70-100% mortality and that has 
      resulted in great economic losses since its first appearance. The cytotoxic
      effect of PirAB(Vp) on the epithelial cells of the shrimp hepatopancreas (Hp) has
      been extensively documented. New insights into the biological role of the
      PirB(Vp) subunit show that it has lectin-like activity and recognizes mucin-like 
      O-glycosidic structures in the shrimp Hp. The search for toxin receptors can lead
      to a better understanding of the infection mechanisms of the pathogen and the
      prevention of the host disease by blocking toxin-receptor interactions using a
      mimetic antagonist. There is also evidence that Vp AHPND changes the community
      structure of the microbiota in the surrounding water, resulting in a significant 
      reduction of several bacterial taxa, especially Neptuniibacter spp. Considering
      these findings, the PirAB(vp) toxin could exhibit a dual role of damaging the
      shrimp Hp while killing the surrounding bacteria.

TI  - Ecological and Human Health Risk Assessment of Heavy Metals in Cultured Shrimp
      and Aquaculture Sludge.
LID - 175 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/toxics10040175 [doi]
AB  - Shrimp is one of the major export products in South Asian countries and also an
      eminent source of nutrition for humans. Hence, any negative effect of this
      industry may affect not only the country's economy but also human health.
      Therefore, in this study, we aimed to assess heavy metal contamination and
      associated human health risks in cultured shrimp (Penaeus monodon) and
      aquaculture sludge collected from three shrimp farms of the Cox's Bazar district,
      Bangladesh. The results showed that among the eight metals studied, Pb (17.75 +/-
      1.5 mg/kg) and Cu (9.43 +/- 2.8 mg/kg) levels in all shrimp samples were higher
      than the recommended limit, whereas the concentrations of Cd (0.09 +/- 0.03
      mg/kg), Mn (4.83 +/- 2.2 mg/kg), As (0.04 +/- 0.02 mg/kg), Hg (0.02 +/- 0.006
      mg/kg), Zn (18.89 +/- 2.9 mg/kg) and Cr (0.69 +/- 0.6 mg/kg) were within the
      permissible level. The concentrations of Mn (1043.37 +/- 59.8 mg/kg), Cr (30.38
      +/- 2.1 mg/kg), Zn (74.72 +/- 1.13 mg/kg) and Cu (31.14 +/- 1.4 mg/kg) in the
      sludge of all farms were higher than the recommended limit, whereas the
      concentrations of Pb (20.23 +/- 1.9 mg/kg), Cd (0.09 +/- 0.2 mg/kg), As (0.44 +/-
      0.34 mg/kg) and Hg (0.08 +/- 0.02 mg/kg) in all sludge samples were lower than
      the threshold limits. However, the estimated daily intake (EDI), targeted hazard 
      quotient (THQ) and hazard index (HI) assessed for potential human health risk
      implications suggested that Pb and Cr may pose non-carcinogenic health effects,
      although carcinogenic risks (CR) values were acceptable for consumers. However,
      the pollution load index (PLI) of the studied area was below 1, which indicates
      low deterioration of the area. Geoaccumulation index (Igeo) and contamination
      factor (CF) analyses revealed that study area is unpolluted and sludge is
      enriched with metals in the following order: Mn &gt; Zn &gt; Cu &gt; Cr &gt; Cd
      &gt; Hg &gt; Pb &gt; As.

AB  - The demand for intelligent packaging in food sub-freshness monitoring is
      increasing. Herein, a pH and NH3 responsing colorimetric film (PS-CH-LCA) was
      fabricated based on potato starch (PS), chitosan (CH) and Lonicera caerulea L.
      anthocyanins (LCA) via controlling the pH value of the film-forming solution, and
      was applied to the real-time monitoring of shrimp freshness. The PS-CH-LCA pH 2.5
      film exhibited the highest tensile strength (6.43 MPa), the lowest water
      solubility (33.11%) and the most sensitive color responsiveness. Morphological
      and structural results revealed that CH was attached to the surface of PS via
      hydrogen bond, and anthocyanins were well immobilized in the film-forming matrix.
      The sensitive color change and its high correlation with spoilage indices
      demonstrated the PS-CH-LCA pH 2.5 film well indicated fresh, sub-fresh, spoiled
      level of shrimp. The results solved the limitation of chitosan-based packaging
      films in undistinguishable colorimetric endpoints, providing a new strategy for
      indicating the sub-freshness of food packaging.

AB  - The worldwide prawn industry strives for better production and environmental
      sustainability. Shrimp feed is one of the most expensive aquaculture inputs;
      therefore, it must be cost-effective and environmentally safe. Fish meals in
      aquaculture are becoming unsustainable due to the cost and environmental
      concerns. The effects of a biogas sludge meal supplement in feed on freshwater
      prawn productivity were studied. This study aimed to examine the growth, survival
      rate, yield, feed conversion ratio, and molting period of giant freshwater prawns
      (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) fed with and without biogas sludge a low-cost
      resource. The four treatments were T1 (0% biogas sludge), T2 (10% biogas sludge),
      T3 (20% biogas sludge), and T4 (30% biogas sludge). Protein content ranged from
      26.7 to 27.4% in the experimental diets. The experiment was conducted in 3 x
      3x1.5 m cages in an earthen pond for 80 days. The data shows that freshwater
      prawn growth performance did not differ significantly across treatments (P >
      0.05). Biogas sludge has been demonstrated to be a low-cost feed component for
      freshwater prawns. Regarding survival, productivity, and feed conversion ratio,
      T2 (10% biogas sludge) outperformed the other two. As a result of the research,
      it was determined that 10% of biogas sludge might be used as a low-cost
      freshwater prawn feed option. The molting period of freshwater prawns fed
      biogas-containing feed was investigated at various levels. Freshwater prawns
      grown in baskets in a pond at 32.2 degrees C for a trial period of 90 days were
      molted differently (P > 0.05). The molting periods for Tl, T2, T3, and T4 were
      19, 18, 19.8, and 20.8, respectively. In addition, the research suggests
      efficient and long-term methods for supplying nutrient-dense prawn feed to
      aquaculture production systems.

      The Wnt5b has been known to promote white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection in
      shrimp but its role in antibacterial response remains unclear. In the current
      study, we focused on the involvement of Wnt5b in Vibrio parahaemolyticus
      infection in Pacific white shrimp Penaeus vannamei. We demonstrated that the
      expression of Wnt5b was regulated by the IMD-Relish and JAK-STAT pathways but not
      the Dorsal pathway and was suppressed upon bacterial infection. Although Wnt5b
      did not affect the cellular immunity in shrimp, it was involved in regulation of 
      humoral immunity. Silencing of Wnt5b in vivo significantly increased expression
      of several antimicrobial peptides but decreased that of many immune functional
      proteins including C-type lectins and lysozymes. Treatment with recombinant Wnt5b
      protein increased the susceptibility of shrimp to V. parahaemolyticus infection, 
      while silencing of Wnt5b in vivo showed an opposite result. These suggested that 
      Wnt5b plays a negative role in antibacterial response in shrimp. Together with
      previous reports, the current study shows that Wnt5b functions as an inhibitor
      for shrimp immunity, which is a potential target for improving immune responses
      against infection.

AB  - The Palaemonetes sinensis aquaculture industry in Panjin City, Liaoning Province,
      China, experienced heavy losses in October 2018. Morbidity of cultured shrimp
      reached 50% and was characterized by cloudiness of muscle and the gradual spread 
      of disease within the population. When the infection was mild, histopathological 
      examinations revealed that the muscle cells contained a considerable number of
      microorganisms. In extreme cases, the structure of the hepatopancreatic glandular
      and muscle fiber was obscured or even vanished. Electron microscope observations 
      revealed the presence of granular cytoplasmic inclusions in cells from
      hepatopancreas and muscle tissues. The 16S rDNA sequence of the intracytoplasmic 
      organism was 94.7% identity to that of Coxiella burnetii. This is the first
      report of infection by C. burnetii in P. sinensis.

TI  - Contact chemoreception in multi-modal sensing of prey by Octopus.
PG  - 435-442
LID - 10.1007/s00359-022-01549-y [doi]
AB  - Octopuses have keen vision and are generally considered visual predators, yet
      octopuses predominantly forage blindly in nature, inserting their arms into
      crevices to search and detect hidden prey. The extent to which octopuses
      discriminate prey using chemo- versus mechano-tactile sensing is unknown. We
      developed a whole-animal behavioral assay that takes advantage of octopuses'
      natural searching behavior to test their ability to discriminate prey from
      non-prey tastes solely via contact chemoreception. This methodology eliminated
      vision, mechano-tactile sensing and distance chemoreception while testing the
      contact chemosensory discriminatory abilities of the octopus arm suckers.
      Extracts from two types of prey (crab, shrimp) and three types of non-prey (sea
      star, algae, seawater) were embedded in agarose (to control for mechano-tactile
      discrimination) and presented to octopuses inside an artificial rock dome;
      octopuses reached their arms inside to explore its contents - imitating natural
      prey-searching behavior. Results revealed that octopuses are capable of
      discriminating between potential prey items using only contact chemoreception, as
      measured by an increased amount of sucker contact time and arm curls when
      presented with prey extracts versus non-prey extracts. These results highlight
      the importance of contact chemoreception in the multi-modal sensing involved in a
      complex foraging behavior.

      vannamei).
PG  - 78-86

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the combination of hairy eggplant
      (Solanum ferox) and bitter ginger (Zingiber zerumbet) on the production
      performance and hematological parameters of whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus
      vannamei). Materials and Methods: Four treatments were formulated in the test
      feed, where P1 (control + commercial vitamin C); P2 (120 ml/l combination of S.
      ferox and Z. zerumbet); P3 (100 ml/l); and P4 (80 ml/l) 6,000 post-larvae shrimp 
      with an average initial weight of 0.2 gm were randomly stocked in four groups,
      with three replications per treatment, and 500 were stocked in each pond with a
      total of 12 pounds. Results: Based on the results, there were significant
      differences in production performance (survival, absolute weight growth, specific
      growth rate, and feed conversion ratio). Biologically, the best performance was
      found in the P3 treatment (100 ml/l). In this treatment, the total number of
      hemocytes and the number of hyaline hemocytes were much higher, and this was not 
      the case in the control treatment (P1), where the number of semi-granular and
      granular cells was significantly higher than the treatment group (p < 0.05).
      Conclusions: This study confirmed that supplementation of 100 ml/l of S. ferox
      and Z. zerumbet could improve the production performance and hemato-immunological
      parameters of whiteleg shrimp, with functional potential to be developed in
      phytobiotic-based commercial diets for shrimp.

TI  - Immobilization of Providencia stuartii Cells in Pumice Stone and Its Application 
      for N-Acetylglucosamine Production.
PG  - 4-10
LID - 10.17113/ftb.60.01.22.6994 [doi]
AB  - Research background: Shrimp shells contain chitin that can be further processed
      into N-acetylglucosamine, which has been extensively used to treat joint damage. 
      Providencia stuartii has a strong chitinolytic activity and may be utilized in
      the form of immobilized cells in repeated fermentation. Pumice is a porous and
      rigid stone that offers superior mechanical strength, making it suitable for
      immobilization. Experimental approach: In the research submerged fermentation
      with different pumice stone sizes and pumice stone/growth medium ratios (m/V) was
      carried out for 4 days at 37 degrees C and pH=7.0. The optimum pumice stone size 
      and pumice stone/growth medium ratio (m/V) were used to determine the optimum
      fermentation cycle for the production of N-acetylglucosamine using immobilized P.
      stuartii. Results and conclusions: Pumice stones of 1.0 cmx1.0 cmx1.0 cm and
      pumice stone/growth medium ratio of 1:5 were found to be the optimum conditions
      for successful immobilization of (90.0+/-1.6) % cells and production of
      (331.4+/-7.3) g/L N-acetylglucosamine. The highest N-acetylglucosamine
      concentration of (323.0+/-2.5) g/L was obtained in the first fermentation cycle, 
      which then decreased and remained stable throughout the last three cycles.
      Novelty and scientific contribution: P. stuartii, a strong chitinolytic bacterium
      previously isolated from rotten shrimp shells, was used for the first time in
      immobilized form to produce N-acetylglucosamine. The findings in this research
      showed the potential use of P. stuartii cells immobilized in pumice stone for
      continuous production of N-acetylglucosamine in repeated fermentation.

BTI - Seafood Consumption during Childhood and Adolescence and Cardiovascular Disease: 
      A Systematic Review
LID - 10.52570/NESR.DGAC2020.SR0504 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This important public health question was identified by the U.S.
      Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Health and Human Services (HHS) to be
      examined by the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. The 2020 Dietary
      Guidelines Advisory Committee, Dietary Fats and Seafood Subcommittee conducted a 
      systematic review to answer this question with support from the Nutrition
      Evidence Systematic Review (NESR) team. The goal of this systematic review was to
      examine the following question: What is the relationship between seafood
      consumption during childhood and adolescence (up to 18 years of age) and risk of 
      cardiovascular disease? CONCLUSION STATEMENT AND GRADE: Insufficient evidence is 
      currently available to accurately determine the relationship between seafood
      consumption during childhood and adolescence and risk of developing
      cardiovascular disease. (Grade: Grade not assignable). METHODS: A literature
      search was conducted using four databases (i.e., PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and
      CINAHL) to identify articles that evaluated the intervention or exposure of
      seafood consumption during childhood and adolescence and the outcomes of
      cardiovascular disease. A manual search was conducted to identify articles that
      may not have been included in the electronic databases searched. Articles were
      screened by two NESR analysts independently for inclusion based on pre-determined
      criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted for each
      included study, and both were checked for accuracy. The Committee qualitatively
      synthesized the body of evidence to inform development of a conclusion statement,
      and graded the strength of evidence using pre-established criteria for risk of
      bias, consistency, directness, precision, and generalizability. SUMMARY OF THE
      EVIDENCE: Four articles, two randomized controlled trials and two prospective
      cohort studies, met inclusion criteria for this systematic review. The 2020
      Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee used the following seafood definition:
      marine animals that live in the sea and in freshwater lakes and rivers. Seafood
      includes fish (e.g., salmon, tuna, trout, and tilapia) and shellfish (e.g.,
      shrimp, crab, and oysters). Few articles were identified that examined the
      relationship between seafood intake during childhood and adolescence and blood
      pressure, lipid levels, and cardiovascular-related mortality, and no articles
      examined the relationship with incidence of cardiovascular disease. Two of four
      included articles had serious methodological limitations that made interpretation
      of the results difficult. Evidence was insufficient and no conclusion could be
      drawn.

      Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Health and Human Services (HHS) to be
      examined by the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. The 2020 Dietary

      examine the following question: What is the relationship between seafood
      consumption during childhood and adolescence (up to 18 years of age) and
      neurocognitive development? CONCLUSION STATEMENTS AND GRADES: Developmental
      domains: Cognitive development: Insufficient evidence is available to determine
      whether there is a favorable relationship between seafood intake during childhood
      and adolescence and measures of cognitive development in children and
      adolescents. However, no unfavorable relationships were found between seafood
      consumption during childhood and adolescence and measures of cognitive
      development. (Grade: Grade not assignable). Language and communication
      development: Insufficient evidence is available to determine whether there is a
      favorable relationship between seafood intake during childhood and adolescence
      and measures of language and communication development in children and
      adolescents. However, no unfavorable relationships were found between seafood
      consumption during childhood and adolescence and measures of language and
      communication development. (Grade: Grade not assignable). Movement and physical
      development: Insufficient evidence is available to determine the relationship
      between seafood intake during childhood and movement and physical development in 
      children. (Grade: Grade not assignable). Social-emotional and behavioral
      development: Insufficient evidence is available to determine the relationship
      between seafood intake during childhood and adolescence and social-emotional and 
      behavioral development in children and adolescents. (Grade: Grade not
      assignable). Attention deficit disorder and Attention-deficit/hyperactivity
      disorder: Insufficient evidence is available to determine the relationship
      between seafood consumption during childhood and adolescence and attention
      deficit disorder or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder-like traits or
      behaviors. (Grade: Grade not assignable). Autism spectrum disorder: No evidence
      is available to determine the relationship between seafood intake during
      childhood and adolescence and autism spectrum disorder-like traits or behaviors
      or autism spectrum disorder diagnosis. (Grade: Grade not assignable). Academic
      performance: Insufficient evidence is available to determine the relationship
      between seafood intake during adolescence and academic performance in
      adolescents. (Grade: Grade not assignable). Anxiety and Depression: Insufficient 
      evidence is available to determine the relationship between seafood consumption
      during childhood and adolescence and anxiety and depression. (Grade: Grade not
      assignable). METHODS: A literature search was conducted using four databases
      (i.e., PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and CINAHL) to identify published literature
      that evaluated the intervention or exposure of seafood consumption during
      childhood and adolescence and the outcome of neurocognitive development. A manual
      search was conducted to identify articles that may not have been included in the 
      electronic databases searched. Articles were screened by two NESR analysts
      independently for inclusion based on pre-determined criteria. Data extraction and
      risk of bias assessment were conducted for each included study, and both were
      checked for accuracy. The Committee qualitatively synthesized the body of
      evidence to inform development of conclusion statements, and graded the strength 
      of evidence using pre-established criteria for risk of bias, consistency,
      directness, precision, and generalizability. SUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE: This review
      includes 13 articles, six articles from three randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
      and seven articles from six prospective cohort studies (PCSs), published between 
      January 2000 and October 2019. The 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee
      used the following seafood definition: marine animals that live in the sea and in
      freshwater lakes and rivers. Seafood includes fish (e.g., salmon, tuna, trout,
      and tilapia) and shellfish (e.g., shrimp, crab, and oysters). The majority of
      studies addressed developmental domains - cognitive development (seven articles),
      language and communication development (five articles), movement and physical
      development (two articles), and social-emotional and behavioral development
      (three articles). No conclusion regarding the relationship between seafood intake
      during childhood and adolescence and developmental domains could be drawn due to 
      an inadequate number of studies, inconsistency in results, risk of bias in
      classification of exposures, and heterogeneity of outcome assessments. Seafood
      intake during childhood and adolescence had a predominantly beneficial or null
      relationship across all domains, and had a few detrimental relationships,
      primarily in social-emotional and behavioral development. Results from three RCTs
      found that three fatty fish meals per week (~50-80 grams per meal) compared to
      meat meals for 12 weeks in adolescents or 16 weeks in children had a
      predominantly null effect on developmental domain outcomes. Results from three
      PCSs generally found a beneficial association between fish intake in children and
      adolescents and developmental domains. The vast majority of analyses showed no
      detrimental relationship between seafood intake during childhood and adolescence 
      and cognitive, language and communication, and movement and physical development.
      No conclusion regarding the relationship between seafood consumption during
      childhood and adolescence and academic performance, attention deficit disorder
      (ADD) or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety and depression,
      and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) could be drawn due to an inadequate number of 
      studies and variation in outcome assessment and child age.

      in the Child: A Systematic Review
LID - 10.52570/NESR.DGAC2020.SR0502 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This important public health question was identified by the U.S.
      Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Health and Human Services (HHS) to be
      examined by the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. The 2020 Dietary
      Guidelines Advisory Committee, Dietary Fats and Seafood Subcommittee conducted a 
      systematic review to answer this question with support from the Nutrition
      Evidence Systematic Review (NESR) team. The goal of this systematic review was to
      examine the following question: What is the relationship between seafood
      consumption during pregnancy and lactation and neurocognitive development in the 
      child? CONCLUSION STATEMENTS AND GRADES: Seafood intake during pregnancy
      Developmental domains: Moderate evidence indicates that seafood intake during
      pregnancy is associated favorably with measures of cognitive development in young
      children. (Grade: Moderate). Limited evidence suggests that seafood intake during
      pregnancy may be associated favorably with measures of language and communication
      development in the child. (Grade: Limited). Insufficient evidence is available to
      determine the relationship between seafood intake during pregnancy and movement
      and physical development in the child. (Grade: Grade not assignable).
      Insufficient evidence is available to determine the relationship between seafood 
      intake during pregnancy and social-emotional and behavioral development in the
      child. (Grade: Grade not assignable). Attention deficit disorder or
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder-like traits or behaviors: Insufficient
      evidence is available to determine the relationship between seafood consumption
      during pregnancy and attention deficit disorder or
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder-like traits or behaviors in the child.
      (Grade: Grade not assignable). Attention deficit disorder or
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder diagnosis: No evidence is available to
      determine the relationship between seafood consumption during pregnancy and
      diagnosis of attention deficit disorder or attention-deficit/hyperactivity
      disorder in the child. (Grade: Grade not assignable). Autism spectrum disorder:
      Insufficient evidence is available to determine the relationship between seafood 
      consumption during pregnancy and autism spectrum disorder-like traits or
      behaviors or autism spectrum disorder diagnosis in the child. (Grade: Grade not
      assignable). Academic performance: No evidence is available to determine the
      relationship between seafood intake during pregnancy and academic performance in 
      the child. (Grade: Grade not assignable). Anxiety: No evidence is available to
      determine the relationship between seafood intake during pregnancy and anxiety in
      the child. (Grade: Grade not assignable). Depression: No evidence is available to
      determine the relationship between seafood intake during pregnancy and depression
      in the child. (Grade: Grade not assignable). Seafood intake during lactation No
      evidence is available to determine the relationship between maternal seafood
      intake during lactation and neurocognitive development in the child. (Grade:
      Grade not assignable). METHODS: A literature search was conducted using 4
      databases (PubMed, Cochrane, Embase and CINAHL) to identify articles that
      evaluated the intervention or exposure of seafood consumption during pregnancy
      and lactation and the outcomes of neurocognitive development. A manual search was
      conducted to identify articles that may not have been included in the electronic 
      databases searched. Articles were screened by two NESR analysts independently for
      inclusion based on pre-determined criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias
      assessment were conducted for each included study, and both were checked for
      accuracy. The Committee qualitatively synthesized the body of evidence to inform 
      development of conclusion statements, and graded the strength of evidence using
      pre-established criteria for risk of bias, consistency, directness, precision,
      and generalizability. SUMMARY OF THE EVIDENCE: Seafood intake during pregnancy : 
      This review included 26 articles from 18 prospective cohort studies (PCSs)
      published between January 2000 and October 2019. The 2020 Dietary Guidelines
      Advisory Committee used the following seafood definition: marine animals that
      live in the sea and in freshwater lakes and rivers. Seafood includes fish (e.g., 
      salmon, tuna, trout, and tilapia) and shellfish (e.g., shrimp, crab, and
      oysters). Developmental domains: Evidence from 21 articles from 15 PCSs indicated
      predominantly beneficial associations between seafood intake during pregnancy and
      measures of cognitive development, including milestone achievement and
      intelligence, particularly in young children. Evidence from 15 articles from 12
      PCSs suggested beneficial associations between seafood intake during pregnancy
      and measures of language and communication development. However, results were
      less consistent than for cognitive development. Furthermore, 8 articles assessed 
      measures of verbal intelligence or verbal intelligence quotient (IQ), which may
      be less specific assessments of language and communication development. Few
      detrimental associations between seafood intake during pregnancy and measures of 
      child cognitive or language development were found. Heterogeneity in exposure and
      assessment methods, and ages of children at follow-up, made it difficult to
      determine a relationship between seafood intake during pregnancy and movement and
      physical development or social-emotional and behavioral development. Four
      articles, from 3 PCSs, found inconsistent results when examining the relationship
      between seafood intake during pregnancy and attention deficit disorder (ADD)-like
      or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like traits or behaviors in
      the child, with studies reporting either null or protective associations. Three
      PCSs assessed autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-like traits or behaviors or ASD
      diagnosis but heterogeneity in outcome assessment methods and child age across
      the 3 PCSs made it difficult to determine a relationship between seafood intake
      during pregnancy and ASD-like traits or behaviors or ASD diagnosis. No studies
      that met inclusion criteria assessed the relationship between seafood intake
      during pregnancy and academic performance, anxiety or depression in the child.
      Thirteen articles accounted for maternal mercury exposure and most found that
      controlling for mercury exposure strengthened or had little impact on the
      association between seafood intake during pregnancy and developmental outcomes.
      There were limitations in the evidence: Heterogeneity in seafood intake
      categories used to compare seafood intake levels across studies made it difficult
      to assess precision and compare magnitude of associations. Key confounders were
      not consistently accounted for and there was heterogeneity in exposures,
      outcomes, and child age. Seafood intake during lactation No studies that met
      inclusion criteria assessed the relationship between maternal seafood intake
      during lactation and neurocognitive development in the child.

AB  - Decomposition in seafood products in the United States is monitored by the Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) laboratories using sensory testing, which requires 
      highly trained analysts. A large-volume headspace (LVHS) gas chromatography/mass 
      spectrometry (GC/MS) method was developed to generate analytical results that can
      be directly compared to sensory evaluation. Headspace vapor was withdrawn from a 
      1-L vial containing 50 g seafood sample using a large volume headspace
      autosampler. Various volatile compounds were collected simultaneously. Analytes
      were preconcentrated by a capillary column trapping system and then sent through 
      a cryo-focuser mounted onto the GC injector. A selected ion monitoring (SIM) MS
      acquisition method was used to selectively monitor 38 compounds of interest.
      Samples of red snapper, croaker, weakfish, mahi-mahi, black tiger shrimp,
      yellowfin tuna, and sockeye salmon that have been assessed and scored by an FDA
      National Seafood Sensory Expert (NSSE) were used for method performance
      evaluation. Characteristic compounds potentially associated with seafood quality 
      deterioration for each seafood species were identified by quantitative analysis
      using pooled matrix-matched calibrations and two-sample t-test statistical
      analysis. Classification of fresh and decomposed samples was visualized on the
      analysis of variance (ANOVA)-principal component analysis (PCA) score plots. The 
      results determined that the LVHS-GC/MS technique appeared promising as a
      screening tool to identify compounds representative of sensory analysis.

TI  - Shrimp sensitization in house dust mite algerian allergic patients: A single
      center experience.
PG  - 100642
LID - 10.1016/j.waojou.2022.100642 [doi]
AB  - Background: Cross-reactivity between shrimp and house dust mite (HDM) proteins
      has been widely documented. However, a significant geographical variability in
      sensitization patterns and cross-reactive allergens has been reported which may
      impact the diagnosis and management of shrimp allergy among HDM-shrimp
      co-sensitized patients. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of shrimp 
      and tropomyosin sensitization among HDM-allergic patients in order to understand 
      the local epidemiology to inform the development of targeted diagnostic and
      therapeutic tools. Methods: Four hundred forty-six (446) HDM-allergic patients
      and 126 atopic controls were screened for shrimp-specific IgE using the IMMULITE 
      2000 XPI(R) System. HDM-shrimp sensitized subjected were also tested for IgE
      tropomyosin (nPen m 1) and thoroughly interviewed about their shellfish
      consumption habits. Tropomyosin sensitized patients were subjected to further
      analysis including measurement of IgE specific to squid and crab. Results: The
      prevalence of shrimp sensitization in the HDM-allergic population was 20.4% vs 0%
      in the control group. Of them 63.7% were clinically allergic to shrimp, while 9
      cases had no history of allergic reaction to this food and 24 patients reported
      not having consumed shrimp before. Besides, 72.5% of the HDM-shrimp sensitized
      subjects had tropomyosin-specific IgE with a positivity rate of 82.8% among
      shrimp-allergic patients. Among tropomyosin reactors, 95.5% were sensitized to
      crab and 89.5% to squid, none of them had previously ingested neither crab nor
      squid. Nevertheless, one-third of HDM-shrimp sensitized patients who never
      consumed shrimp before did not react to tropomyosin. Conclusions: Shrimp allergy 
      seems to be strictly dependent on HDM sensitization, at least in this
      geographical area. Therefore, HDM allergic patients should be systematically
      screened for shrimp sensitization and asked about the consumption of shellfish.
      Tropomyosin is a major and clinically relevant shrimp allergen that accounts for 
      shellfish-HDM cross-reactivity. However, other components could be involved.

AB  - Astaxanthin (Axn), a feed additive, is becoming increasingly important for
      modulating the metabolism, growth, development, and reproduction of aquatic
      organisms in aquaculture. In this study, Exopalaemon carinicauda (E. carinicauda)
      is an economically important fishery species in China that has been found to
      exhibit increased body weight following Axn feeding as compared to a standard
      diet. The antioxidant, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses of the response
      of E. carinicauda after Axn feeding were investigated. Axn could reduce the
      content of malondialdehyde and increase the activities of various antioxidant
      enzymes, which also proved that axn can improve the antioxidant capacity
      Transcriptomic analysis suggested that synthesis and secretion of immune
      proteins, cytoskeleton structure, and apoptosis signaling were altered after Axn 
      feeding. The metabolic response to axn mainly includes the up regulation of
      different amino acids and the change of unsaturated fatty acids. Combined
      transcriptomic and metabolomic data indicated that amino acid metabolic pathways 
      were upregulated in the muscles after Axn feeding. For good measure, energy
      metabolism pathways were upregulated in the muscles to improve ATP and
      unsaturated fatty acid production. This study provides key information to
      increase our understanding of the effects of Axn in shrimp.

TI  - Agavin induces beneficial microbes in the shrimp microbiota under farming
      conditions.

AB  - Prebiotics and probiotics have shown a number of beneficial impacts preventing
      diseases in cultured shrimps. Complex soluble carbohydrates are considered ideal 
      for fostering microbiota biodiversity by fermentable oligosaccharides,
      disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPS). Here we evaluated the
      growth performance and microbiota composition of the white shrimp Litopenaeus
      vannamei after dietary intervention using agavin as a FODMAP prebiotic under
      farming conditions. Adult L. vannamei were raised at a shrimp farm and the effect
      of agavin supplemented at 2% (AG2) or 10% (AG10) levels were compared to an
      agavin-free basal diet (BD). After 28 days-trial, the feed conversion ratio,
      total feed ingested, and protein efficiency ratio was significantly improved on
      animals fed with AG2. At the same time, no effect on growth performance was
      observed in AG10. Surprisingly, after sequencing the V3-V4 regions of the 16S
      rRNA gene a higher microbial richness and diversity in the hepatopancreas and
      intestine was found only in those animals receiving the AG10 diet, while those
      receiving the AG2 diet had a decreased richness and diversity, both diets
      compared to the BD. The beta diversity analysis showed a clear significant
      microbiota clustering by agavin diets only in the hepatopancreas, suggesting that
      agavin supplementation had a more substantial deterministic effect on the
      microbiota of hepatopancreas than on the intestine. We analyzed the literature to
      search beneficial microbes for shrimp's health and found sequences for 42 species
      in our 16S data, being significantly increased Lactobacillus pentosus,
      Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonas synxantha in the hepatopancreas of the AG10
      and Rodopseudomonas palustris and Streptococcus thermophiles th1435 in the
      hepatopancreas of the AG2, both compared to BD. Interestingly, when we analyzed
      the abundance of 42 beneficial microbes as a single microbial community
      "meta-community," found an increase in their abundance as agavin concentration
      increases in the hepatopancreas. In addition, we also sequenced the DNA of agavin
      and found 9 of the 42 beneficial microbes. From those, Lactobacillus lactis and
      Lactobacillus delbrueckii were found in shrimps fed with agavin (both AG2 and
      AG10), and Lysinibacillus fusiformis in AG10 and they were absent the BD diet,
      suggesting these three species could be introduced with the agavin to the diet.
      Our work provides evidence that agavin supplementation is associated with an
      increase of beneficial microbes for the shrimp microbiota at farming conditions. 
      Our study provides the first evidence that a shrimp prebiotic may selectively
      modify the microbiota in an organ-dependent effect.

AB  - Polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) are emerging organic pollutants that are
      harmful to the environment and human health. In this study, a headspace
      solid-phase-microextraction (HS-SPME)-gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
      method for the separation and enrichment of PCNs in shrimp was developed and
      validated. A graphene aerogel was prepared by modifying graphene oxide with a
      deep eutectic solvent to prevent graphene oxide stacking. As a result, the
      aerogel had a three-dimensional porous structure, which resulted in easy
      sorption/desorption for PCNs, and was used as the SPME fiber coating. Next, the
      experimental parameters for the saponification of the sample matrix and the
      extraction and desorption of the PCNs were systematically optimized. After
      optimization, the method showed good linearity (R(2)>/=0.9968), low limits of
      detection (0.00983-0.0661 pg g(-1)), and satisfactory recoveries (80.4-108%).
      Crucially, compared with previously reported methods, this method does not
      require the use of large amounts of organic reagents or complex operations,
      giving it the advantages of simplicity, sensitivity, and environmental
      friendliness. As an example of the practical application of the developed method,
      the PCNs in river and sea shrimp were quantified.

AB  - To explore the immune function of C-type lectin in shrimp, one recombinant C-type
      lectin (LvLec) was injected into Litopenaeus vannamei. There were four treatments
      in the experiment: saline group (as control group), recombinant C-type lectin
      group (LvLec, 1 mg mL(-1)), Vibrio harveyi group (V. harveyi, 10(6) cfu mL(-1))
      and recombinant C-type lectin combined with Vibrio harveyi group (LvLec + V.
      harveyi, 1 mg mL(-1) + 10(6) cfu mL(-1)). The sampling time was set at 0, 3, 6,
      9, 12, 24 h after the injection. The results showed that the total hemocyte count
      decreased significantly and the phagocytic activity improved notably after the
      injection of LvLec, V. harveyi or LvLec + V. harveyi. Prophenoloxidase (proPO)
      activity decreased, while phenoloxidase (PO) activity increased and the changing 
      degree of each group exhibited a significant difference. The hemagglutinating
      activity and bacteriolytic activity improved significantly, while the
      antimicrobial activity did not show a remarkable change in all of the groups.
      There were also changes that occurred in the levels of second messengers (cAMP,
      cGMP) and protein kinase (PKA, PKG). After the injection of LvLec, V. harveyi or 
      LvLec + V. harveyi, the concentration of cGMP and PKA increased significantly,
      while the concentration of cAMP and PKG did not change remarkably. The results
      above suggested that rLvLec could induce nonspecific immune response, including
      phagocytosis, release of PO, hemagglutination and bacteriolysis through cGMP-PKA 
      pathway in vivo.

AB  - Numerous studies have proved that endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress is an
      important cause of aquatic animal diseases. Therefore, for effectively preventing
      and controlling aquatic animal diseases, a systematic and in-depth understanding 
      of the environmental stress response in aquatic animals is necessary. In present 
      study, the influence of ER-stress in Litopenaeus vannamei was investigated using 
      Illumina HiSeq based RNA-Seq. Comparing to the cDNA library of hemocytes treated 
      with DMSO in L. vannamei, 286 unigenes were significantly upregulated and 473
      unigenes were significantly down-regulated in the Thapsigargin treated group.
      KEGG analysis indicated that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are mainly
      related to ER-stress, immune as well as metabolism. Besides the classical
      ER-stress response pathways, the regulation of cell cycle and DNA replication are
      also important measures of ER-stress response. It has been suggested that the
      influence of ER-stress on immune genes might be an important factor in
      environmental stress inducing shrimp disease. Our investigation exhibited that
      immune-related DEG Prophenoloxidase activating enzyme 2 (LvPPAE2) roled in
      anti-pathogen immunity of shrimp. This study provides a solid foundation for
      uncovering the environmental adaptation response and especially its relationship 
      with L. vannamei immune system.

TI  - Allergens sensitization among children with allergic diseases in Shanghai, China:
      age and sex difference.
PG  - 95
LID - 10.1186/s12931-022-02008-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The distribution of allergens has geographic characteristics. Local
      epidemiological data provides evidence-based strategies for the prevention and
      management of allergic diseases. Age and sex differences may exist in the
      prevalence of sensitivity to various allergens. We investigated the distribution 
      of common allergens in allergic children in Shanghai, southeastern China.
      METHODS: 39,926 children 1 month to 18 years of age diagnosed with allergic
      diseases were tested for the presence of serum-specific Immunoglobulins E (sIgE) 
      to 17 allergens common to this region, using a reversed enzyme allergosorbent
      test. RESULTS: 25,757 (64.5%) of the subjects showed elevated sIgE to at least
      one of the tested allergens. House mite and dust mite were the most common
      aeroallergens, while egg and milk were the most common food allergens. The most
      common aeroallergens and food allergens were similar among each allergic disease.
      By age-group analysis, the positive rates of aeroallergens were higher at older
      age. Several peaks of sensitization to food allergens were observed in children
      between 1 and 3 years of age for eggs, milk, nut, crab and shrimp. In addition,
      the sensitization to beef and mango was highest in children 3-6 years of age. The
      rate of positive sIgE detection was higher in males than females for all the
      tested allergens except cockroach, trees and beef. Considering the interplay
      between sex and ages and other related components (including season, monthly
      temperature, humidity, air quality index, test rate of patients), the sIgE
      positive rates of the main aeroallergens increased with age, while the main food 
      allergens decreased; males are more sensitive to several aeroallergens (including
      dust mite, house mite, cat epithelium, dog epithelium and mulberry). CONCLUSIONS:
      House mite, dust mite, milk, and egg are major allergens in Shanghai. Children at
      younger age are more sensitive to food allergens, while increasing overall
      prevalence of sensitization can be found with increasing age. Boys have higher
      positive rates of sIgE responses than girls. Knowledge of the prevalence of
      allergen sensitization in different age groups and sex may help facilitate
      diagnosis and intervention efforts to mitigate the impact of allergic diseases in
      this large geographical region. This approach may be extrapolated to other
      regions.

TI  - Antimicrobial activity of silver sulfide quantum dots functionalized with highly 
      conjugated Schiff bases in a one-step synthesis.
PG  - 3136-3146
LID - 10.1039/d1ra08296e [doi]
AB  - In the present paper, low-dimensional Ag2S QDs were fabricated for the first
      time, with four different dithiocarbazate derivative Schiff bases (SB) as capping
      agents in a one-pot synthesis. These SB-capped Ag2S QDs were almost spherical
      with an average size range of 4.0 to 5.6 nm, which is slightly smaller than
      conventional thioglycolic acid (TGA)-capped Ag2S QDs. We demonstrate that the
      growth of Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtillus and Staphylococcus aureus), 
      Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and a
      prevalent fungal pathogen (Candida albicans) are inhibited more when the
      bacterial and fungal cells were nurtured with the synthesized SB-Ag2S QDs,
      compared with TGA-Ag2S QDs or free unbound Schiff bases. The minimum inhibitory
      concentration (MIC) results confirmed that even low concentrations of SB-Ag2S QDs
      were able to inhibit bacterial (MIC 5-75 mug mL(-1)) and fungal growth (MIC
      80-310 mug mL(-1)), and in some cases they performed better than streptomycin
      (8-25 mug mL(-1)). Lethality bioassay results confirmed that SB-Ag2S QDs were not
      toxic to brine shrimp (Artemia salina). The results show that capping agents are 
      essential in the design of functional Ag2S QDs, and highlight that Schiff bases
      provide an excellent opportunity to optimize the biological activities of silver 
      based QDs.

AB  - Antibiotic pollution poses serious threats to public health and ecological
      processes. However, systematic research regarding the interactive effects of
      increasing nutrient and antibiotic pollutions on the prokaryotic community,
      particularly taxa that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, is lacking. By
      exploring the complex interactions that occur between interkingdom bacteria and
      archaea, biotic and abiotic factors, the responses of sediment prokaryotic
      assembly were determined along a significant antibiotic pollution gradient.
      Bacterial and archaeal communities were primarily governed by sediment antibiotic
      pollution, ammonia, phosphate, and redox potential, which further affected enzyme
      activities. The two communities nonlinearly responded to increasing antibiotic
      pollution, with significant tipping points of 3.906 and 0.979 mg/kg antibiotics, 
      respectively. The combined antibiotic concentration-discriminatory taxa of
      bacteria and archaea accurately (98.0% accuracy) diagnosed in situ antibiotic
      concentrations. Co-abundance analysis revealed that the methanogens,
      methanotrophs, sulfate-reducing bacteria, and novel players synergistically
      contributed to methane cycling. Antibiotic pollution caused the dominant role of 
      ammonia-oxidizing archaea in ammonia oxidation at these alkaline sediments.
      Collectively, the significant tipping points and bio-indicators afford indexes
      for regime shift and quantitative diagnosis of antibiotic pollution,
      respectively. Antibiotic pollution could expedite methane cycling and mitigate
      nitrous oxide yield, which are previously unrecognized ecological effects. These 
      findings provide new insights into the interactive biological and ecological
      consequences of increasing nutrient and antibiotic pollutions.

      of Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, Pb, V, and Co were determined using the enrichment
      factor (EF), geoaccumulaton index (Igeo), and potential ecological risk index
      (PERI). The average concentration is shown to be substantially lower than the
      background value. In general, the Igeo values indicated that the pollution
      conditions of different land use types in SKMNNR are relatively minor. Most of
      the PERI values were at the moderate level. This study demonstrates that the
      current status of sediment quality in SKMNNR is relatively good, and the
      pollution level is relatively low. Large-scale coastal aquaculture development
      and industrial expansion should not no longer be permitted there.

AB  - Hypoxic zones are spreading worldwide in marine environments affecting many
      organisms. Shrimp and other marine crustaceans can withstand environmental
      hypoxia using several strategies, including the regulation of energy producing
      metabolic pathways. Pyruvate carboxylase (PC) catalyzes the first reaction of
      gluconeogenesis to produce oxaloacetate from pyruvate. In mammals, PC also
      participates in lipogenesis, insulin secretion and other processes, but this
      enzyme has been scarcely studied in marine invertebrates. In this work, we
      characterized the gene encoding PC in the white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei,
      modelled the protein structure and evaluated its gene expression in
      hepatopancreas during hypoxia, as well as glucose and lactate concentrations. The
      PC gene codes for a mitochondrial protein and has 21 coding exons and 4
      non-coding exons that generate three transcript variants with differences only in
      the 5'-UTR. Total PC expression is more abundant in hepatopancreas compared to
      gills or muscle, indicating tissue-specific expression. Under hypoxic conditions 
      of 1.53 mg/L dissolved oxygen, PC expression is maintained in hepatopancreas,
      indicating its key role even in energy-limited conditions. Finally, both glucose 
      and lactate concentrations were maintained under hypoxia for 24-48 h in
      hepatopancreas.

AB  - Shellfish consumption in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) exceeds local supply and 
      frozen fish and seafood products are imported to fill the gap. To determine the
      species in frozen shellfish brands on the UAE markets, 95 frozen samples were
      subjected to PCR amplification and sequencing of the hypervariable region of the 
      16S rDNA. This identified 11 different shrimp species and two squid species in
      the frozen shellfish packs. About 40% of calamari brands contained peanut worm,
      cattle, and rat 16S rDNA. Also, most shellfish species analyzed had low
      nucleotide diversity, including two shrimp species (Litopenaeus vannamei and
      Metapenopsis barbata), which had very limited genetic diversity, low raggedness, 
      and an absence of population expansion. Species misnaming, substitution,
      overexploitation, origin misreporting, and low genetic diversity were found
      across frozen UAE shellfish samples analyzed, suggesting inspection and
      monitoring of frozen seafood sold in UAE markets would be appropriate.

AB  - Dissolved CO2 levels (pCO2) are increasing in lentic freshwaters across the
      globe. Recent studies have shown that this will impact the nutritional quality of
      phytoplankton as primary producers. However, the extent to which freshwater
      zooplankton may also be directly affected remains unclear. We test this in three 
      model species representative of the main functional groups of primary consumers
      in freshwaters; the water flea Daphnia magna, the seed shrimp Heterocypris
      incongruens and the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus. We experimentally exposed
      individuals to three pCO2 levels (1,500; 25,500 and 83,000 ppm) to monitor
      changes in life history in response to current, elevated and extreme future pCO2 
      conditions in ponds and shallow lakes. All species had reduced survival under the
      extreme pCO2 treatment, but the water flea was most sensitive. Body size and
      reproduction were reduced at 25,500 ppm in the water flea and the seed shrimp and
      population growth was delayed in the rotifer. Overall, our results show that
      direct effects of pCO2 could impact the population dynamics of freshwater
      zooplankton. By differentially modulating the life history of functional groups
      of primary consumers, elevated pCO2 has the potential to change the evolutionary 
      trajectories of populations as well as the ecological functioning of freshwater
      communities.

TI  - Core Gut Microbiota of Shrimp Function as a Regulator to Maintain Immune
      Homeostasis in Response to WSSV Infection.
PG  - e0246521
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.02465-21 [doi]
AB  - The gut microbiota is an integral part of the host and has a functional potential
      in host physiology. Numerous scientific efforts have opened new horizons in gut
      microbiota research and enhanced the understanding of host-microbe interactions
      in vertebrates. However, evidence on the association between the gut microbiota
      and immunity in invertebrates, especially in shrimp, which is an important
      aquatic animal, is limited. Herein, we conducted a comprehensive analysis based
      on 16S rRNA gene sequencing and liquid chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry
      (LC-MS) to investigate the correlation between them. Comparing the gut microbiota
      among the four different species of shrimp, we found huge variations and
      determined a core gut microbiota composed of 55 microbes. The environmental
      challenge of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection led to changes in core
      microbial structures, but the alteration of core microbiota among different
      shrimp followed the same trend and showed immune-related function in the
      prediction of its metabolic potential. In metabolomic analysis, nine
      significantly upregulated metabolites found after viral infection indicated that 
      they have antiviral potential. Moreover, we found a tight correlation between
      them and almost half of the core microbiota. These data demonstrate that these
      metabolites are responsible for maintaining the immune homeostasis of the host
      and prove the function of the gut microbiota and the related metabolome in
      antiviral immunity of shrimp. IMPORTANCE Abundant gut microorganisms constitute a
      complex microecosystem with the intestinal environment of the host, which plays a
      critical role in the adjustment of various physiological states of the organism. 
      Sequencing and mass spectrometry data collected from intestinal samples of shrimp
      after virus infection helped to investigate the special function of the
      microecosystem and suggested that the gut microbiota has a functional potential
      in maintaining immune homeostasis of the host under environmental challenge.

TI  - Sucrose addition directionally enhances bacterial community convergence and
      network stability of the shrimp culture system.
PG  - 22
LID - 10.1038/s41522-022-00288-x [doi]
AB  - Sucrose is an effective carbon source for creating more reliable and
      environmentally friendly conditions for shrimp growth by regulating bacteria in
      biofloc-based culture systems. However, the influence of sucrose addition on the 
      interaction, co-occurrence networks, and assembly mechanisms of bacterial
      communities in biofloc-based culture systems remains largely unknown. Here, we
      comprehensively investigated the effects of sucrose addition on bacterial
      communities in three habitats (water, bioflocs, and gut). The bacterial community
      structures and compositions of these three habitats became more similar in groups
      with sucrose addition, compared with those in controls. More than 50% gut
      bacterial communities were mainly derived from water and biofloc communities in
      the sucrose addition groups, but only about 33% bacterial communities migrated
      from water and biofloc to the gut in the control culture system. Sucrose addition
      accordantly enriched core taxa belonging to the phylum Actinobacteria and the
      families Rhodobacteraceae and Flavobacteriaceae in water, biofloc, and gut
      habitats. These core taxa were important for maintaining bacterial network
      stability in the sucrose addition culture systems and some were identified as
      keystone taxa for improving shrimp growth. Furthermore, after sucrose addition,
      gut bacterial community assembly from water and biofloc was dominated by the
      heterogeneous select with the ratios of 55-91% and 67-83%, respectively,
      indicating that sucrose addition can directionally shape the bacterial assembly

TI  - Green Synthesis of BPL-NiONPs Using Leaf Extract of Berberis pachyacantha:
      Characterization and Multiple In Vitro Biological Applications.
LID - 2064 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27072064 [doi]
AB  - An eco-friendly biogenic method for the synthesis of nickel oxide nanoparticles
      (NiONPs) using phytochemically rich Berberis pachyacantha leaf extract (BPL) was 
      established. To achieve this purpose, 80 mL of BPL extract was used as a suitable
      reducing and capping agent for the synthesis of NiONPs. The synthesis of
      BPL-based nickel oxide nanoparticles (BPL@NiONPs) was confirmed using different
      microscopic and spectroscopic techniques: UV Visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis),
      Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy
      dispersive X-ray (EDX), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and scanning electron
      microscopy (SEM) analysis. Spectroscopically, BPL-NiONPs was found with a pure
      elemental composition (oxygen and nickel), average size (22.53 nm) and
      rhombohedral structure with multiple functional groups (-OH group and Ni-O
      formation) on their surface. In the next step, the BPL extract and BPL@NiONPs
      were further investigated for various biological activities. As compared to BPL
      extract, BPL@NiONPs exhibited strong biological activities. BPL@NiONPs showed
      remarkable antioxidant activities in terms of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl
      (76.08%) and total antioxidant capacity (68.74%). Antibacterial action was found 
      against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (27 mm), Staphylococcus aureus (20 mm) and
      Escherichia coli (19.67 mm) at 500 microg/mL. While antifungal potentials were
      shown against Alternaria alternata (81.25%), Fusarium oxysporum (42.86%) and
      Aspergillus niger (42%) at 1000 microg/mL. Similarly, dose-dependent cytotoxicity
      response was confirmed against brine shrimp with IC50 value (45.08 microg/mL).
      Additionally, BPL@NiONPs exhibited stimulatory efficacy by enhancing seed
      germination rate at low concentrations (31.25 and 62.5 microg/mL). In conclusion,
      this study depicted that BPL extract has important phytochemicals with remarkable
      antioxidant activities, which successfully reduced and stabilized the BPL@NiONPs.
      The overall result of this study suggested that BPL@NiONPs could be used as
      nanomedicines and nanofertilizers in biomedical and agrarian fields.

AB  - Fermentative and antioxidative characteristics of Godulbaegi kimchi (LGK), a
      traditional, fermented Korean food, were conducted. For the study, LGK kimchi was
      made of Godulbaegi kimchi with pepper powder, salted shrimp, refined salt, green 
      onions, and so on, and fermented at 5C for 6 months. The pH was decreased, and
      total acidity was increased during fermentation. Furthermore, lactic acid
      bacteria and yeast were increased, while the total viable count was decreased.
      The LGK showed the highest DPPH-scavenging activity, phenol content, and
      nitrite-scavenging activity with methanol extract among methanol, ethanol, and
      water. In addition, we screened strains among LGK kimchi with high antimicrobial 
      activity and isolated them. We tested antimicrobial activity for 20 lactic acid
      bacteria, and we separated and identified nine strains of lactic acid bacteria
      with high antimicrobial activity. Given these results, LGK is expected to be an
      effective food in considerable antioxidative activity with an antimicrobial
      effect. These results are expected to serve as basic data for the study of
      Godulbaegi kimchi.

TI  - Antioxidant, Cytotoxic, and Rheological Properties of Canola Oil Extract of Usnea
      barbata (L.) Weber ex F.H. Wigg from Calimani Mountains, Romania.
LID - 854 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/plants11070854 [doi]
AB  - Usnea genus (Parmeliaceae, lichenized Ascomycetes) is a potent phytomedicine, due
      to phenolic secondary metabolites, with various pharmacological effects.
      Therefore, our study aimed to explore the antioxidant, cytotoxic, and rheological
      properties of Usnea barbata (L.) Weber ex F.H. Wigg (U. barbata) extract in
      canola oil (UBO) compared to cold-pressed canola seed oil (CNO), as a green
      solvent used for lichen extraction, which has phytoconstituents. The antiradical 
      activity (AA) of UBO and CNO was investigated using UV-Vis spectrophotometry.
      Their cytotoxicity was examined in vivo through a brine shrimp lethality (BSL)
      test after Artemia salina (A. salina) larvae exposure for 6 h to previously
      emulsified UBO and CNO. The rheological properties of both oil samples (flow
      behavior, thixotropy, and temperature-dependent viscosity variation) were
      comparatively analyzed. The obtained results showed that UBO (IC50 = 0.942 +/-
      0.004 mg/mL) had a higher 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging
      activity than CNO (IC50 = 1.361 +/- 0.008 mg/mL). Both UBO and CNO emulsions
      induced different and progressive morphological changes to A. salina larvae,
      incompatible with their survival; UBO cytotoxicity was higher than that of CNO.
      Finally, in the temperature range of 32-37 degrees C, the UBO and CNO viscosity
      and viscoelastic behavior indicated a clear weakening of the intermolecular bond 
      when temperature increases, leading to a more liquid state, appropriate for
      possible pharmaceutical formulations. All quantified parameters were highly
      intercorrelated. Moreover, their significant correlation with trace/heavy
      minerals and phenolic compounds can be observed. All data obtained also suggest a
      possible synergism between lichen secondary metabolites, minerals, and canola oil
      phytoconstituents.

      with Chromatographic Separation for Indole Analysis in Shrimp.
PG  - 1194-1200
LID - 10.1021/acssensors.2c00300 [doi]
AB  - We developed an organic solvent-compatible paper-based analytical device (PAD)
      for the quantitative analysis of indole, which is an indicator of shrimp
      freshness. Although indole is insoluble in water, ethyl acetate is a suitable
      solvent to dissolve and extract indole from shrimp. The PADs are fabricated using
      a cutting method that allows the use of an organic solvent because no hydrophobic
      barrier is needed to form fluidic channels. Ehrlich's reagent consists of
      4-(dimethylamino)benzaldehyde and p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and was deposited
      onto the reaction zone of the PAD followed by lamination to prevent evaporation
      of the ethyl acetate. Samples are introduced into the PAD via immersion in
      organic sample solutions. When the PAD is immersed into an indole solution of
      ethyl acetate in a closed bottle, the sample solution penetrates the channel of
      the PAD and successively flows into the detection zone to form a hydrophilic
      colored product. The PADs provide a linear relationship between the logarithm of 
      the indole concentration and the color intensity within a range of 1.0-20 ppm
      with correlation coefficients of r(2) > 0.99. The limits of detection and
      quantification are 0.36 and 0.71 ppm, respectively. Relative standard deviations 
      for both the intraday (n = 2) and interday (n = 3) precision were less than 2.5%.
      In the indole analysis of shrimp, the PADs separated the interfering
      orange-colored astaxanthin in the extract from the colored product of indole via 
      the paper chromatographic principle. We used the PADs to investigate the
      degradation of shrimp, and the results showed a rapid increase in the indole
      level after 7 days. High-performance liquid chromatography verified the accuracy 
      of the PADs by showing good agreement with the obtained indole levels.

TI  - Evaluation of Potential Probiotic Properties of a Strain of Lactobacillus
      plantarum for Shrimp Farming: From Beneficial Functions to Safety Assessment.
PG  - 854131
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.854131 [doi]
AB  - In recent years the safety of probiotics has received increasing attention due to
      the possible transfer and spread of virulence factors (VFs) and antibiotic
      resistance genes (ARGs) among microorganisms. The safety of a strain of
      Lactobacillus plantarum named W2 was evaluated in phenotype and genotype in the
      present study. Its probiotic properties were also evaluated both in vivo and in
      vitro, including adherence properties, antibacterial properties and beneficial
      effects on the growth and immunity of Pacific white shrimp, Penaeus vannamei.
      Hemolysis tests, antibiotic resistance tests and whole genome sequence analysis
      showed that W2 had no significant virulence effects and did not carry high
      virulence factors. W2 was found to be sensitive to chloramphenicol, clindamycin, 
      gentamicin, kanamycin and tetracycline, and to be resistant to ampicillin and
      erythromycin. Most ARGs have no transfer risk and a few have transfer risk but no
      significant enrichment in human-associated environments. The autoaggregation of
      W2 was 82.6% and the hydrophobicity was 81.0%. Coaggregation rate with Vibrio
      parahaemolyticus (24.9%) was significantly higher than Vibrio's autoaggregation
      rate (17.8%). This suggested that W2 had adhesion potential to mucosal/intestinal
      surfaces and was able to attenuate the adherence of V. parahaemolyticus. In
      addition, several adhesion-related protein genes, including 1 S-layer protein, 1 
      collagen-binding protein and 9 mucus-binding proteins were identified in the W2
      genome. W2 had efficiently antagonistic activity against 7 aquatic pathogenic
      strains. Antagonistic components analysis indicated that active antibacterial
      substances might be organic acids. W2 can significantly promote the growth of
      shrimp when supplemented with 1 x 10(10) cfu/kg live cells. Levels of 7
      serological immune indicators and expression levels of 12 hepatopancreatic
      immune-related genes were up-regulated, and the mortality of shrimp exposed to V.
      parahaemolyticus was significantly reduced. Based on the above, L. plantarum W2
      can be applied safely as a potential probiotic to enhance the growth performance,
      immunity capacity and disease resistance of P. vannamei.

AB  - The potential impacts of sub-surface hydrocarbon plumes to deep-water column
      micronekton are an important consideration in a more complete understanding of
      ecosystem effects resulting from deep-sea oil spills. However, evaluating
      toxicity in these organisms presents multiple challenges, and the use of a
      shallow-water proxy species allows comparison and validation of experimental
      results. This study thus examined the suitability of the peppermint shrimp,
      Lysmata boggessi, as an experimental proxy for ecologically important deep-sea
      zooplankton/micronekton in hydrocarbon toxicity assays. This crustacean species
      occurs in shallow coastal marine environments throughout the western Atlantic,
      Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, is similar in size to the mesopelagic organisms
      previously tested and is readily available via commercial aquaculture. The
      effects of 1-methylnaphthalene and fresh Macondo oil (MC252) on L. boggessi were 
      assessed in 48-h constant-exposure toxicity tests, and acute thresholds were
      compared to previously determined LC50s for oceanic mid water Euphausiidae,
      Janicella spinacauda, Systellaspis debilis, Sergestes sp., Sergia sp. and the
      mysid shrimp Americamysis bahia. Acute thresholds and the calculated critical
      target lipid body burden (CTLBB) for the shallow-water L. boggessi were
      comparable to the deep-water species tested, suggesting that L. boggessi may be a
      suitable proxy for some mesopelagic micronekton species in acute hydrocarbon
      exposures.

TI  - Nutritional programming by maternal diet alters offspring lipid metabolism in a
      marine teleost.
PG  - 535-553
LID - 10.1007/s10695-022-01069-1 [doi]
AB  - Nutritional programming - the association between the early nutritional
      environment and long-term consequences for an animal - is an emerging area of
      research in fish biology. Previous studies reported correlations between maternal
      provisioning of essential fatty acids to eggs and the whole-body fatty acid
      composition of larvae reared under uniform conditions for red drum, Sciaenops
      ocellatus. This study aimed to further investigate the nutritional stimulus and
      the consequences of nutritional programming by feeding adult red drum several
      distinct diets and rearing larvae under uniform conditions until 21 days
      post-hatching when larval lipid and fatty acid compositions were assessed.
      Different maternal diets produced eggs with distinctive lipid and fatty acid
      compositions, and despite receiving the same larval diet for almost 3 weeks,
      larvae showed differences in total fatty acid accumulation and in retention of
      highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA). Specifically, larvae reared from a
      maternal diet of shrimp generally showed elevated levels of fatty acids in the
      initial steps of the n-3 and n-6 HUFA biosynthetic pathways and reduced levels of
      fatty acid products of the same pathways, especially in triglyceride.
      Furthermore, the variations in larval fatty acid accumulation induced by maternal
      diet varied among females. Lipid metabolism altered by parental diet may have
      consequences for larval physiological processes and behavioral performance, which
      may ultimately influence larval survival.

AB  - Antibiotic usage to control infectious diseases in shrimp aquaculture has led to 
      serious problems on antimicrobial resistance. An alternative to mitigate this
      issue is the use of probiotics, which can be easily administered by feed and
      water. This study examines immunomodulatory and protective effects of the marine 
      yeasts Debaryomyces hansenii CBS8339 (Dh) and Yarrowia lipolytica Yl-N6 (Yl)
      -alone and mixed-in white shrimp Penaeus vannamei post-larvae. Administration
      routes (fed and water alone or in combination), supplementation frequency and
      time elapsed after the last dietary supplement were tested on growth and gene
      expression of penaeidin, lectin, lysozyme, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and
      peroxidase, as well as survival upon Vibrio parahaemolyticus IPNGS16 challenge.
      Penaeidin and lectin genes were upregulated in post-larvae fed orally with Yl or 
      combined Dh + Yl. Higher growth and survival for yeast supplementation treatments
      were observed compared to the control group, mainly when yeasts (Dh + Yl) and
      administration routes (feed and water) were combined. In conclusion, mixed yeast 
      and combined administration routes improved growth and immunity against V.
      parahaemolyticus.

TI  - The potential role of eyestalk in the immunity of Litopenaeus vannamei to Vibrio 
      parahaemolyticus infection II. From the perspective of long non-coding RNA.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been linked to immunological modulation.
      Unfortunately, little is known about the processes of immune control in shrimp.
      In crustaceans such as Litopenaeus vannamei, a prominent aquaculture species, the
      X-organ-sinus gland complex (XO-SG) in the eyestalk is an essential
      neuroendocrine regulatory organ. Eyestalk ablation is commonly employed in
      aquaculture to accelerate ovarian maturation in shrimp. It does, however, have a 
      negative impact on the shrimps' immunocompetence and causes death. As a result,
      we used RNA-seq to profile the transcriptomes of L. vannamei hemocytes infected
      with Vibrio parahaemolyticus after the eyestalk ablation. Following strict
      transcript screening procedures, 2307 lncRNAs were identified from L. vannamei
      hemocytes in this study. Pearson correlation analysis was finally used to uncover
      535 DElncRNAs and 1566 DEmRNA targets. According to the Venn diagram analysis,
      326 non-eyestalk regulatory lncRNAs (NElncRNAs) with a target of 1014
      non-eyestalk regulatory genes (NEmRNAs), 47 eyestalk negative regulatory lncRNAs 
      (ENRlncRNAs) with a target of 95 eyestalk negative regulatory genes (ENRmRNAs),
      and 162 eyestalk positive regulatory lncRNAs (EPRlncRNAs) with a target of 457
      eyestalk positive regulatory genes (EPRmRNAs) were screened. The bioinformatics
      analysis revealed that lncRNAs were associated with Axon regeneration, Rap1
      signaling pathway, Thyroid hormone signaling pathway, TGF-beta signaling pathway,
      and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, implying that lncRNAs may play a role in the
      regulation of the neuroendocrine-immune (NEI) system. Furthermore, several
      lncRNAs targeting HSP70, YWHAZ, FER2, HIF1alpha, and Notch were discovered and
      verified by qRT-PCR. These findings showed that regulation of lncRNAs in
      hemocytes which were controlled by the eyestalk might be one of the impact
      variables in controlling the differential expression of mRNAs associated with
      immune response in L. vannamei infected with V. parahaemolyticus.

AB  - Juvenile hormone epoxide hydrolase (JHEH) participates in the degradation of
      juvenile hormone and also involved in the development and molting process in
      insects. Here, the JHEH homolog in Pennaus vannamei was cloned and found to
      consist of a full-length cDNA of 2543 bp and an open reading frame (ORF) of 1386 
      bp. Transcripts of PvJHEH1 were expressed in most tissues of healthy shrimp with 
      the highest found in the hepatopancreas and lowest in hemocytes. Both
      Gram-negative (Vibrio parahaemolyticus) and Gram-positive (Streptococcus iniae)
      bacteria induced PvJHEH1 expression in shrimp hemocytes and hepatopancreas,
      suggesting the involvement of PvJHEH1 in P. vannamei immune responses. Moreover, 
      the mRNA levels of ecdysone inducible nuclear transcription factor PvE75 and
      crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (PvCHH), two endocrine-related genes with roles 
      in shrimp innate immune response, decreased significantly in shrimp hemocytes
      after PvJHEH1 knockdown. Shrimp survival was also affected after PvJHEH1
      knockdown followed by V. parahaemolyticus challenge, indicating that JHEH1 plays 
      an essential role in shrimp survival during bacterial infection.

AB  - A new stomatopod-associated species of the alpheid shrimp genus Athanas Leach,
      1814 is described based on several specimens collected in shallow waters of
      northern New Caledonia. Athanas philippei n. sp. differs from all of its
      congeners by a unique combination of morphological characteristics, as well as a 
      diagnostic colour pattern. All specimens of A. philippei n. sp. were collected
      from burrows, including one with its host, a large tiger mantis shrimp,
      Lysiosquillina maculata (Fabricius, 1793) (Lysiosquillidae). Thus, the new
      species represents the fifth species of Athanas known or presumed to be
      associated with the spacious burrows of stomatopods.

AB  - A new species of the alpheid shrimp genus Richalpheus Anker Jeng, 2006 is
      described on the basis of 10 specimens collected from three locations in
      Kagoshima Prefecture, Kyushu, Japan. Richalpheus laeuadigitus n. sp. appears
      close to R. palmeri Anker Jeng, 2006 and R. dahabensis Anker Dworschak, 2007
      among the three known congeners, but differs from R. palmeri in the
      proportionally wider telson and the more proximally located tip of the antennular
      stylocerite, and from R. dahabensis in the different configuration of the major
      cheliped fingers, in particular the possession of a well-developed bulge-like
      ridge on the occlusal margin of the dactylus. Two sequences of the mitochondrial 
      16S rRNA gene from two of the paratypes are newly obtained, and compared with
      that of R. palmeri downloaded from the GenBank database. The new species is the
      fourth representative of Richalpheus. Possible association between the new
      species and other infaunal invertebrates is suggested, although not specified.

PG  - 269-280
LID - 10.11646/zootaxa.5105.2.6 [doi]
AB  - A new alpheid shrimp genus, Crosnierocaris gen. nov., is established for
      Crosnierocaris athanasoides sp. nov., a very peculiar shrimp possibly associated 
      with decomposing sea grass accumulations in deeper water. The type series of C.
      athanasoides sp. nov. was collected in the Mozambique Channel, north of Grande
      Glorieuse Island, at a depth of 240255 m. The new genus presents a unique
      combination of morphological features, including the very long, slender rostrum
      armed with a subdistal ventral tooth; the pterygostomial angle projecting as a
      strong sharp tooth; the third to fifth pleura with their distoventral margins
      armed with two to four small teeth, a unique feature within the Alpheidae; the
      sixth pleuron with an articulated plate; the eyes largely exposed dorsally and
      laterally; the first pereiopods (chelipeds) feebly enlarged in both sexes,
      stouter but shorter than walking legs; the first pereiopod carpus with rows of
      short serrulate setae on its mesial surface; the second pereiopod carpus with
      five subdivisions; the third to fifth pereiopods with meri armed with stout
      cuspidate setae; the uropodal diaeresis with a strongly dentate lateral portion; 
      and the complete gill-exopod formula, with mastigobranchs on coxae of the third
      maxilliped and first to fourth pereiopods. Within alpheid shrimps, the rostrum of
      C. athanasoides sp. nov. is one of the longest relative to the total body length,
      often reaching half of the carapace length. The phylogenetic position of
      Crosnierocaris gen. nov. within the Alpheidae remains to be determined, but based
      on its morphological characters, the new genus appears to be closest to Athanas
      Leach, 1814, especially in the configuration of the frontal area of the carapace,
      and Potamalpheops Powell, 1979, for instance, in the armature of the uropodal
      diaeresis and walking legs, as well as the presence of setal rows on the cheliped
      carpus. The new genus also shares several morphological features with Yagerocaris
      Kensley, 1988, which represents one of the least derived lineages within the
      family Alpheidae.

AB  - The rare symbiotic alpheid shrimp Salmoneus erasimorum Dworschak, Abed-Navandi
      Anker, 2000 was previously known from a single specimen collected with a suction 
      pump on the Croatian coast in the Adriatic Sea, together with its host, the ghost
      shrimp, Gilvossius tyrrhenus (Petagna, 1792). A second record of S. erasimorum is
      presented here, with a diagnosis and the first colour photographs, based on a
      single specimen collected in northern Brittany, France, also with a suction pump,
      but without its host. This is also the first record of the species on the
      European coast of the Atlantic Ocean. An annotated list and a key to the species 
      of Salmoneus currently known from the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea 
      are provided.

LID - 10.11646/zootaxa.5092.3.8 [doi]
AB  - The deep-water alpheid shrimp Batella praecipua De Grave, 2004 was originally
      described based on two incomplete specimens, both with their first chelipeds
      missing, collected at 400440 m off New Caledonia. During the recent KANADEEP 1
      expedition in the Coral Sea in 2017, the first complete specimen of B. praecipua 
      was collected at a depth of 370380 m. The morphology of this specimen is
      presented in detail, with emphasis on the highly diagnostic chelipeds, which are 
      described and illustrated for the first time. A slight intraspecific variation of
      B. praecipua is reported and a DNA barcode (CO1) is provided for this species.
      The main differences between the three presently known species of Batella
      Holthuis, 1955 are discussed.

TI  - Checklist of decapod crustaceans from the coast of the So Paulo state (Brazil)
      supported by integrative molecular and morphological data: V. Dendrobranchiata
      and Pleocyemata [Achelata, Astacidea, Axiidea, Caridea (Alpheoidea and
      Processoidea excluded), Gebiidea, Stenopodidea].
PG  - 1-74
LID - 10.11646/zootaxa.5121.1.1 [doi]
AB  - This checklist is the fifth and last compilation on the decapod crustaceans
      reported to So Paulo (Brazil) coastal area, resulting from long-term
      multidisciplinary projects, which combined morphological analyses and molecular
      techniques. The current research includes 75 decapod species, herein referred as 
      shrimps/lobsters-like (shrimps, ghost-shrimps, lobsters, and related groups),
      reported to So Paulo coastal area. These species occur in marine, estuarine, and 
      amphidromous habitats and are classified into 21 families as follow: Aristeidae
      (2 spp., 2 genera), Atyidae (4 spp., 2 genera), Axianassidae (1 sp., 1 genus),
      Callianassidae (1 sp., 1 genus), Callichiridae (6 spp., 4 genera), Crangonidae (1
      sp., 1 genus), Glyphocrangonidae (1 sp., 1 genus), Luciferidae (2 spp., 2
      genera), Nephropidae (4 spp., 2 genera), Palaemonidae (15 spp., 9 genera),
      Palinuridae (2 spp., 1 genus), Pandalidae (1 sp., 1 genus), Pasiphaeidae (1 sp., 
      1 genus), Penaeidae (10 spp., 6 genera), Sergestidae (3 spp., 3 genera),
      Sicyoniidae (4 spp., 1 genus), Scyllaridae (5 spp., 3 genera), Solenoceridae (4
      spp., 3 genera), Stenopodidae (2 spp., 1 genus), and Upogebiidae (6 spp., 1
      genus). We generated new sequences of cytochrome oxidase subunit I (barcode
      region) and 16S genes (51 and 54, respectively) of 54 species. Our examination
      concluded that 75 shrimps/lobsters-like species are reported to the So Paulo
      coast. We excluded Leander tenuicornis (Palaemonidae), Penaeus setiferus
      (Penaeidae), Philocheras gorei (Crangonidae), and Rhynchocinetes typus
      (Rhynchocinetidae) from this list.

AB  - A new species of bivalve mollusk dwelling palaemonid shrimp of the genus
      Odontonia is described from the Berau Islands, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. This
      is the only Odontonia species recorded as a symbiont of a bivalve mollusk, all
      other congeners are known to associate with solitary ascidians. The new species
      belongs to the group wherein the dactylus of the ambulatory pereiopods has an
      accessory tooth. It differs from these species in the absence of a forward
      directed proximal tooth on the flexor margin of the corpus of the ambulatory
      dactyli. It also lacks the small denticles posterior to the distoventral
      accessory tooth on the dactylar corpus.

      Bruce, 1980 (Crustacea: Decapoda: Palaemonidae) from Taiwan.
PG  - 566-578
LID - 10.11646/zootaxa.5081.4.7 [doi]
AB  - The palaemonid shrimp Periclimenaeus rastrifer is here reported from Taiwan based
      on three specimens. It bears a feeble but distinct anterodorsal lobe on the first
      pleonite (not reported before). The mouthparts, not previously described, are
      also remarkable by a multidentate apex of the mandibular incisor, asymmetric
      distal endite of the second maxilla, and expanded dorsal lobe on the second
      maxilliped merus. The species is thus redescribed here. One of the examined
      specimens possesses an unusual rostrum, and malformed telson and uropodal
      spinulation; the latter specimen is described and illustrated in detail,
      including the mouthparts. Previously, the only species in the genus published in 
      faunistic repors from Taiwan were P. wolffi Bruce 1993 and P. gorgonidarum
      (Balss, 1913) recorded from the Taiwan Strait, and the Green Island,
      respectively; P. rastrifer is reported here as the first of the genus from Taiwan
      mainland.

AB  - Tiling patterns are observed in many biological structures. The compound eye is
      an interesting example of tiling and is often constructed by hexagonal arrays of 
      ommatidia, the optical unit of the compound eye. Hexagonal tiling may be common
      due to mechanical restrictions such as structural robustness, minimal boundary
      length, and space-filling efficiency. However, some insects exhibit tetragonal
      facets.(1-4) Some aquatic crustaceans, such as shrimp and lobsters, have evolved 
      with tetragonal facets.(5-8) Mantis shrimp is an insightful example as its
      compound eye has a tetragonal midband region sandwiched between hexagonal
      hemispheres.(9)(,)(10) This casts doubt on the naive explanation that hexagonal
      tiles recur in nature because of their mechanical stability. Similarly,
      tetragonal tiling patterns are also observed in some Drosophila small-eye
      mutants, whereas the wild-type eyes are hexagonal, suggesting that the ommatidial
      tiling is not simply explained by such mechanical restrictions. If so, how are
      the hexagonal and tetragonal patterns controlled during development? Here, we
      demonstrate that geometrical tessellation determines the ommatidial tiling
      patterns. In small-eye mutants, the hexagonal pattern is transformed into a
      tetragonal pattern as the relative positions of neighboring ommatidia are
      stretched along the dorsal-ventral axis. We propose that the regular distribution
      of ommatidia and their uniform growth collectively play an essential role in the 
      establishment of tetragonal and hexagonal tiling patterns in compound eyes.

      food security and circular economy.

AB  - Sustainable management of natural resources is critical to food security. The
      shrimp feed and fishery sector is expanding rapidly, necessitating the
      development of alternative sustainable components. Several factors necessitate
      the exploration of a new source of environmentally friendly and nutrient-rich
      fish feed ingredients. Microalgal biomass has the potential to support the growth
      of fish and shrimp aquaculture for global food security in the bio-economy. Algal
      biorefineries must valorize the whole crop to develop a viable microalgae-based
      economy. Microalgae have the potential to replace fish meal and fish oil in
      aquaculture and ensure sustainability standards. Microalgae biomasses provide
      essential amino acids, valuable triglycerides such as lipids, vitamins, and
      pigments, making them suitable as nutritional supplements in livestock feed
      formulations. Fish and microalgae have similar nutritional profiles, and
      digestibility is a critical aspect of the aquafeed formulation. A highly
      digestible feed reduces production costs, feed waste, and the risk of
      eutrophication. Due to low input costs, low carbon footprint, wastewater
      treatment benefits, and carbon credits from industrial CO2 conversion,
      microalgae-based fish and shrimp feeds have the potential to provide significant 
      economic benefits. However, several challenges must be addressed before
      microalgal biomass and bioproducts may be used as fish feeds, including heavy
      metal bioaccumulation, poor algal biomass digestion, and antinutrient effects.
      Knowledge of biochemical composition is limited and diverse, and information on
      nutritional value is scattered or contradictory. This review article presents
      alternative approaches that could be used in aquaculture to make microalgal
      biomass a viable alternative to fish meal.

TI  - Rhino Conjunctivitis and Asthma Among Seafood Processing Workers in Greenland. A 
      Cross-Sectional Study.
PG  - 747011
LID - 10.3389/falgy.2021.747011 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: The fishing- and the seafood processing industries are the largest 
      industrial sectors in Greenland. Despite this, only a few cases of occupational
      diseases in this industry have been reported to the Danish Labor Market
      Insurance. Occupational asthma and allergy are well-known occupational diseases
      in the seafood processing industry worldwide and underreporting of occupational
      diseases in Greenland is suspected. Objective: The aim of the current study was
      to examine the associations between job exposures and occupational asthma and
      rhino conjunctivitis in workers in the Greenlandic seafood processing industry
      and to compare the prevalence of sensitization by type and degree of exposure to 
      snow crab, shrimp, fish, and the fish parasite, Anisakis simplex. Methods: Data
      from 382 Greenlandic seafood processing workers were collected during 2016-2018. 
      Data included questionnaire answers, lung function measurements, skin prick
      tests, and blood samples with ImmunoCAP. For all analyses, p < 0.05 was
      considered the level of significance. Results: 5.5% of the workers had
      occupational asthma and 4.6% had occupational rhino conjunctivitis. A large
      proportion of the workers were sensitized to allergens specific to the workplace;
      18.1% to snow crab, 13.6% to shrimp, 1.4% to fish, and 32.6% to the fish
      parasite, A. simplex. We found a dose-response relationship between the risk of
      being sensitized to snow crab and A. simplex and years of exposure to the
      allergens in the seafood processing industry. Conclusion: This study showed that 
      a considerable proportion of workers in the Greenlandic seafood processing
      industry had occupational asthma and rhino conjunctivitis. Additionally, the
      study showed high sensitization levels toward snow crab, shrimp, and the fish
      parasite, A. simplex. This supports the hypothesis of a considerable degree of
      underreporting of occupational allergic airway disease in the Greenlandic seafood
      processing industry. Prospectively, it is important to inform workers, leaders,
      and health care professionals of the health problems and the law on worker's
      compensation, and to initiate preventive actions at factory and trawler level.

AB  - Asian countries have unique ways of food processing and dietary habits that may
      explain the observed differences in the prevalence, natural history, epidemiology
      and sensitization pattern of food allergic diseases when compared to western
      countries. Per capita consumption of seafood, including fish and shellfish, is
      well above the global average for many Asian countries because of their coastal
      geographical location and rich seafood supply. The wide availability and high
      abundance of seafood in Asian countries have shaped a diverse way of processing
      and eating this major food group. Such unique features have significant impact on
      the sensitization profile and allergenicity of Asians to fish and shellfish. For 
      example, fish and shellfish are eaten raw in some countries that may promote
      sensitization to heat-labile allergens not otherwise seen in other regions.
      Fermented fish sauce is commonly used as a condiment in some countries which may 
      promote fish sensitization. Shrimp head and shrimp roe are regarded as delicacies
      in some countries, but their allergen profiles are yet to be characterized.
      Freshwater fish and shellfish are a common food source in many Asian countries
      but the allergenicity of many such species remains unknown. In this review, we
      discuss factors that may contribute to differences in molecular profile and
      sensitization pattern for fish and shellfish that are observed in Asian
      populations and revisit the current status of seafood allergy in this part of the
      world. Acknowledging the similarities and differences of seafood allergy patterns
      between Asian and western populations can help us refine a better strategy for
      diagnosing and managing seafood allergy.

AB  - Weathered plastic litter is recognized as hazardous secondary microplastics(MPs) 
      in the coastal and marine ecosystems, which are of high concern due to their
      greater impact on the environment. The present study aims to elucidate the
      impacts of environmentally weathered polyethylene (wPE) MPs on ingestion, growth 
      and enzymatic responses in Penaeus vannamei. The Penaeus vannamei was chronically
      exposed to five varying concentration (0.1 mg-0.5 mg) of wPE particles in the
      size range between 43 and 32 mum for a period of 25days, followed by 5days
      depuration. At the end of exposure, a considerable number of wPE particles were
      observed from <2 to 14 per individual organism. However, around 60% of the wPE
      particles were removed after the depuration phase. The toxic exposure on P.
      vannamei resulted in significant changes in the enzymatic and growth responses
      with increasing concentration and duration. In addition, growth assessment
      confirmed that wPE exposure inhibited the growth of organism, and the effect was 
      particularly evident at increasing concentrations and prolonged exposure. Also
      observed an elevated levels of lipid peroxidation, glutathione-S-transferases,
      whereas lower levels of reduced-glutathione and catalase at all exposed
      concentrations. This study confirmed that the ingestion of wPE was completely
      influenced by exposure duration, rather than the concentrations of administered. 
      The present biomarker assay might act as an appropriate oxidative stress index
      for wPE toxicity. Findings of this study is useful in providing the basic
      biological information for environmental risk assessments of MPs, which are of
      high concern due to the rising input of microplastics into the environment.

AB  - An efficient, reliable, and sensitive multiclass analytical method has been
      expanded to simultaneously determine 15 human pharmaceutical residues in fish and
      shrimp tissue samples by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass
      spectrometry. The investigated compounds comprise ten classes, namely, analgesic,
      antibacterial, anticonvulsant, cardiovascular, fluoroquinolones, macrolides,
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory, penicillins, stimulant, and sulfonamide. A simple
      liquid extraction procedure based on 0.1% formic acid in methanol was developed. 
      Chromatographic conditions were optimized, and mobile phase A was 0.1% ammonium
      acetate, and mobile phase B was acetonitrile. The mobile phase's gradient program
      was as follows: 0-2 min, 15% B; 2-5 min, linear to 95% B; 5-10 min, 95% B; and
      10-12 min. The limits of detection were from 0.017 to 1.371 mug/kg, while a
      quantification range was measured from 0.051 to 4.113 mug/kg. Finally,
      amoxicillin, azithromycin, caffeine, carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin,
      clarithromycin, diclofenac, erythromycin, furosemide, ibuprofen, ketoprofen,
      naproxen, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and triclosan were quantifiable in fish
      and shrimp samples.

TI  - Assessing discards in an illegal small-scale fishery using fisher-led reporting.
PG  - 963-974

AB  - About a third of all marine fish in the world are caught in Small-Scale Fisheries
      (SSF). SSF are increasingly recognised as essential for food security and
      livelihoods for vulnerable and economically fragile communities globally.
      Although individual SSF vessels are usually perceived as having little impact on 
      the ecosystem, the cumulative impact of gear type and number of vessels may be
      substantial. Bottom trawling is a common fishing method that can greatly
      influence the marine ecosystem by damaging the seafloor and generating high
      levels of discards. However, appropriate sampling coverage using on-board
      observer programmes to collect these data from SSF are rare, as they are
      expensive and pose logistical constraints. A mobile App was used to assess
      whether self-reporting by fishers could provide reliable fine-scale information
      on fishing effort and discards over time in an illegal shrimp trawling fishery in
      northern Peru. Maps depicting the spatial distribution of trawling effort and the
      proportion of discards from observers and fishers were compared using the
      Similarity in Means (SIM) Index, which ranges from 0 when spatial patterns differ
      completely to 1 when spatial patterns are very similar. High levels of agreement 
      between spatio-temporal patterns of effort (SIM Index = 0.81) and discards (0.96)
      were found between fisher and observer maps. Moreover, far greater spatial
      coverage was accomplished by fishers, suggesting that self-reporting via an App
      represents a useful approach to collect reliable fisheries data as an initial
      step for effective monitoring and management of these fisheries. Supplementary

AB  - Background and Aim: Cancer is one of the leading causes of death, the need for
      new anticancer herbal drugs is becoming more urgent considering the side effects 
      of synthetic drugs. This study aimed to determine the anticancer activity of
      isolates derived from the methanol extract of Annona squamosa Linn. leaves and to
      identify the compounds that have an active effect against HeLa cells. Materials
      and Methods: The leaf metabolites of A. squamosa L. were extracted using methanol
      at room temperature (28 degrees C) and were partitioned into n-hexane,
      chloroform, and n-butanol. The toxicity test of these extracts was conducted
      using a brine shrimp lethality assay. Furthermore, the most toxic extracts were
      separated and purified using silica gel column chromatography to yield four
      isolate fractions: FA, FB, FC, and FD. The most toxic isolates were tested for
      anticancer against HeLa cells, and their compounds were identified using liquid
      chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results: The results showed that the most toxic
      isolate with an LC50 value of 100.00 ppm had a potency similar to that of an
      anticancer agent with an IC50 value of 70.9021 ppm. Furthermore, the five
      compounds identified in this isolate include (6S,
      7aR)-6-hydroxy-4,4,7a-trimethyl-6,7-dihydro-5H-1-benzofuran-2-one or loliolide,
      cocamidopropyl betaine, N-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]dodecanamide or
      lauramidopropyl dimethylamine, linolenic acid, and 1-dodecyl-2-azepanone or
      laurocapram. Conclusion: It can be concluded that the leaf isolates of A.
      squamosa Linn. had shown anticancer activities against cervical cancer.

AB  - The mitigation of vibriosis in shrimp culture could be accomplished by reducing
      the virulence of the pathogen or by increasing the immune response of the shrimp.
      This study aims to evaluate the application of a biofloc system in protecting
      Pacific white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) from pathogenic Vibrio parahaemolyticus
      infection. Shrimp post-larvae (PL 20) with an average body weight of 0.041 +/-
      0.019 g were reared in an aquarium with a working volume of 33 L at a density of 
      3 L(-1) for 21 days using two rearing systems, i.e., the biofloc system and the
      regular clear water system as control. In each system, the shrimp post-larvae
      were challenged by adding V. parahaemolyticus at different densities, 10(3),
      10(5), and 10(7) CFU mL(-1), while the negative control was performed by
      maintaining shrimp post-larvae in the clear water system without the addition of 
      V. parahaemolyticus. The results of the in vitro experiment showed that the
      density and biofilm activity of V. parahaemolyticus reared in biofloc suspension 
      was lower than that of the positive control (p < 0.05). The density of V.
      parahaemolyticus in shrimp rearing water was lower than that in the control at
      10(5) CFU mL(-1), especially on the 3rd day post-challenge, but there was no
      significant difference in the total presumptive Vibrio count between the biofloc 
      treatment and the control. The survival, growth, and immune response parameters, 
      such as total hemocyte count, phagocytic activity, respiratory burst, and
      phenoloxidase activity, of the shrimp, reared in the biofloc system were also
      higher than those of the positive control (p < 0.05), regardless of the density
      of V. parahaemolyticus. The present study demonstrated that the application of
      biofloc could significantly protect and increase the resistance of Pacific white 
      shrimp against pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus infection.

TI  - p53 knock-down and hypoxia affects glutathione peroxidase 4 antioxidant response

AB  - Hypoxia (<2 mg O2/L) is one of the main environmental stressors that affects
      aquatic organisms, including the white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). During
      hypoxia, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation induces oxidative stress and 
      damage to biomolecules. Redox state and ROS overproduction are modulated by the
      antioxidant system that is composed of several antioxidant enzymes, proteins, and
      other small compounds. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) has emerged as an
      important antioxidant enzyme with cytoprotective roles. In vertebrates,
      antioxidant and pro-oxidant stress responses are regulated by several factors,
      including the p53 protein. However, little is known about GPx4 responses in
      crustaceans and the regulation by p53. Herein we analyzed and characterized the
      L. vannamei GPx4 and evaluated the responses to hypoxia and p53 knock-down. We
      found a unique GPx4 gene that produces five transcript variants (TVs) and only
      two protein isoforms with distinct cellular localization. GPx4 expression in
      hepatopancreas during hypoxia and p53 knock-down changed during short and
      long-term hypoxia, suggesting that GPx4 may be a sensitive indicator of
      antioxidant imbalance during stress. Knock-down of p53 induced a reduction in
      GPx4 expression, indicating that p53 modulates GPx4 responses during stress. This
      agrees with our findings of putative consensus sequences for p53 in the GPx4 gene
      promoter by in silico analysis. Also, the antioxidant response was effective in
      preventing major protein damage during hypoxia since no changes were detected in 
      carbonylated proteins content in hepatopancreas during hypoxia. Conversely, p53

AB  - The presence of microplastics in the aquatic environment poses a serious threat
      not only to aquatic organisms but also to human beings that consume them. The
      uptake and effects of microplastics have been studied in almost all groups of
      aquatic organisms. This review details the different aspects of microplastics
      exposure in an ecologically and economically important group of crustaceans, the 
      Decapods. A majority of Decapod crustaceans such as prawns, shrimp, crabs,
      lobsters and crayfish are consumed as seafood and play important roles in food
      chains and food webs. Numerous studies are available on the accumulation of
      microplastics in tissues such as the gills, hepatopancreas and gastrointestinal
      tract in these organisms. Experimental studies have also highlighted the toxic
      effects of microplastics such as oxidative stress, immunotoxicity and
      reproductive and developmental toxicity in them. This review also summarizes the 
      ecological impacts and implications in human beings as well as lacunae with
      regard to microplastic uptake in Decapods.

AB  - This study evaluated the effectiveness of shrimp shell biochar (SBC) and nickel
      (Ni) loaded SBC in increasing methane yield during anaerobic digestion of food
      waste. The results indicated that the methane yields of control (without SBC),
      SBC, SBC loaded with the low concentration of Ni, and SBC loaded with the high
      concentration of Ni were 81.8, 116.1, 134.7, and 99.2 mL/(g.VS), respectively.
      SBC promoted the efficiency and stability of the whole anaerobic digestion
      process including hydrolysis, volatile fatty acid conversion and methanogenesis. 
      While the invigorating effect of loaded Ni at the low concentration of 0.88 mg/g 
      was mainly concentrated in methanogenesis, the inhibition effect of the high Ni
      concentration was comprehensive. SBC helped Methanosarcina proliferation, and low
      concentration Ni promoted the number and activity of Methanosarcina and
      Methanosaeta. The results show that biochar loaded with a low level of trace
      elements such as Ni can promote the anaerobic digestion process.

AB  - In recent decades the development of desalination plants (DPs) for desalination
      of seawater has increased dramatically, while little attention has been paid to
      the effects of this activity on the accumulation of heavy metals (HMs) in the
      sediments of affected ecosystems. The present study was implemented to evaluate
      (1) heavy metal accumulation in sediments impacted by DPs discharges, (2) spatial
      and temporal changes of HMs and the contamination degree by different types of
      pollution indexes (single and integrated indices), and (3) ecological risk
      assessment of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) in sediments
      affected by DPs discharges. A total of 288 sediment samples were collected
      seasonally at 24 stations from November 2019 to October 2020. Analysis of HMs
      concentrations in sediments near the desalination plant discharge provided
      evidence of local contamination. Maximum concentration of Cu and Pb elements were
      found in sediments near the desalination plant discharge point. Hierarchical
      cluster analysis revealed clear segregation of stations impacted by desalination 
      plant discharges and away from discharges. The values of PLI index in sediments
      of all sampling stations were < 1, indicating that there was no metal pollution
      by this index. The potential ecological risk index (PERI) ranged from 5.33 +/-
      0.51 to 11.81 +/- 4.98 in sampling sediments and were classified as "low
      potential ecological risk". These results demonstrate that the DPs discharge
      increased HMs concentrations in the sediments in close proximity to outlets. The 
      necessary and practical regulations and policies regarding the rejection of the
      DPs discharge and disposal of chemical compounds must be implemented and
      enforced.

TI  - Typical scaled food web structure and total mercury enrichment characteristics in
      Xingkai Lake, China.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-19874-9 [doi]
AB  - Different from the widely used constant discrimination factor Delta(15)N = 3.4
      per thousand between two adjacent trophic positions (TPs), a scaled Delta(15)N
      framework for evaluating the TP of species was developed in 2014, that is, the
      Delta(15)N between two adjacent TPs decreases as the TP increases which is
      considered to be in closer conformity to the trophic cascade in the natural food 
      web. In this study, we compared the two TP calculation methods and then
      reconsidered the evaluation of the trophic magnification factors (TMFs). Our
      results show that the TPscaled value is higher and the TMFs value is lower under 
      the scaled Delta(15)N framework, indicating that the TMFs value under the
      constant Delta(15)N framework is often overestimated. We further constructed a
      diet proportion food web model, which shows that species with lower TP has higher
      contribution rate as food sources. In Xingkai Lake, the enrichment process of
      mercury in the food web is not strictly consistent with the diet proportion of
      the food web. Based on the diet proportion food web model and the mercury
      enrichment model, it can be found that the White shrimp (Exopalaemon modestus) is
      not only an important food source, but also the main source of mercury
      transmission in the food web. Overall, our findings have quantified the food web 
      construction and thus facilitated a better understanding of the interaction
      between the diet proportion and the bio-concentration in the food web.

TI  - Chemoprotection mediated by acai berry (Euterpe oleracea) in white shrimp

      assays and docking modeling.

AB  - Saxitoxin (STX) is a neurotoxic cyanotoxin that also generate reactive oxygen
      species, leading to a situation of oxidative stress and altered metabolism. The
      Amazonian fruit acai Euterpe oleracea possesses a high concentration of
      antioxidant molecules, a fact that prompted us to evaluate its chemoprotection
      activity against STX toxicity (obtained from samples of Trichodesmium sp.
      collected in the environment) in the shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. For 30 days,
      shrimps were maintained in 16 aquaria containing 10 shrimps (15% salinity, pH
      8.0, 24 degrees C, 12C/12D photoperiod) and fed twice daily with a diet
      supplemented with lyophilized acai pulp (10%), in addition to the control diet.
      After, shrimps (7.21 +/- 0.04 g) were exposed to the toxin added to the feed for 
      96 h. Four treatments were defined: CTR (control diet), T (lyophilized powder of 
      Trichodesmium sp. 0.8 mug/g), A (10% of acai) and the combination T + A. HPLC
      analysis showed predominance of gonyautoxin-1 concentrations (GTX-1) and
      gonyautoxin-4 concentrations (GTX-4). The results of molecular docking
      simulations indicated that all variants of STX, including GTX-1, can be a
      substrate of isoform mu of the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) enzyme since these
      molecules obtained similar values of estimated Free Energy of Binding (FEB), as
      well as similar final positions on the binding site. GSH levels were reduced in
      muscle tissues of shrimp in the T, A, and T + A treatments. Increased GST
      activity was observed in shrimp hepatopancreas of the T treatment and the gills
      of the A and T + A treatments. A decrease of protein sulfhydryl groups (P-SH) was
      observed in gills of shrimps from T + A treatment. A reduction in malondialdehyde
      (MDA) levels was registered in the hepatopancreas of the T + A treatment in
      respect to the Control, T, and A treatments. The use of acai supplements in L.
      vannamei feed was able to partially mitigate the toxic effects caused by
      Trichodesmium sp. extracts, and points to mu GST isoform as a key enzyme for

AB  - The structure and function of ferritin from seafood has been largely unexplored. 
      In this study, homopolymeric scallop ferritin (ApF) was prepared for the first
      time, the apo form of which exhibited the stronger ability to protect DNA from
      iron-induced oxidative damage as compared to its analogue, homopolymeric shrimp
      ferritin (MjF). Their difference in DNA-protective activity was derived from less
      hydroxyl radicals produced during iron oxidation in the presence of scallop
      ferritin than shrimp ferritin. The kinetic results showed that apo-ApF catalyzed 
      the faster ferrous ions oxidation by oxygen into nontoxic ferric ions as compared
      to apo-MjF. Newly reported crystal structure of ApF revealed that its stronger
      ferroxidase activity stemmed from different structures in the triple axis channel
      and ferroxidase site as compared to MjF. All these new findings advance our
      understanding of the relationship between the structure and function of
      food-related protein.

TI  - Taking advantage of transparency: A proof-of-principle for the analysis of the
      uptake of labeled microplastic particles by organisms of different functional
      feeding guilds using an adapted CUBIC protocol.

AB  - The analysis of the ingestion of microplastics (MP) by biota is frequently
      performed through invasive procedures such as chemical digestion protocols or by 
      histological analysis of thin sections. Different, promising approaches for the
      observation of ingested MP particles pose so called tissue clearing methods. They
      are currently applied to organs, tissue samples, or whole organisms, rendering
      the sample transparent and enable to look inside an otherwise opaque environment.
      To date, there is a lack of methods to detect labeled MP inside an opaque
      organism's digestive tract without interfering with the sample's integrity.
      Therefore, our goal was to adapt the CUBIC tissue clearing protocol (Clear,
      Unobstructed Brain/Body Imaging Cocktails and Computational Analysis) for aquatic
      and terrestrial organisms of various functional feeding groups for the analysis
      of the uptake of fluorescent labeled microplastic (MP) particles. We included the
      buff-tailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris, the compost worm Eisenia fetida, the
      woodlouse Porcellio scaber, the freshwater shrimp Gammarus roeselii, and the
      quagga mussel Dreissena bugensis in the analysis. The adapted CUBIC method has
      led to transparency in all normally opaque organisms. It further offers a simple 
      way of locating fluorescent labeled MP inside the digestive system of the
      different organisms while leaving them intact.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics studies of eugenol in Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus
      vannamei) after immersion bath.
PG  - 122

AB  - BACKGROUND: Eugenol is the most commonly used plant anesthetic to relieve the
      stressors during various aquaculture procedures. This study aims to investigate
      the pharmacokinetics of eugenol in Pacific white shrimp by immersion baths in a
      simulated transportation. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetics of eugenol were firstly
      investigated in Pacific white shrimp by immersion baths of 300 mg L(- 1) eugenol 
      over 5 min (Treatment 1), 10 mg L(- 1) eugenol during 24 h (Treatment 2) and a
      sequential immersion administration (Treatment 3). Concentrations of eugenol in
      hemolymph, hepatopancreas, and muscle were determined using Gas
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). After immersion bath of
      Treatment 1, the elimination half-life (t1/2z) values are 1.3 h and 11 h for
      hepatopancreas and muscles, indicating the rapid absorption and elimination of
      eugenol in shrimp. Under the Treatment 2 administration, the eugenol peak
      concentration is 6527.9 mug/kg in muscle, followed by 402.8 mug/kg in
      hepatopancreas, with the lowest concentration of 37.9 mug/L in hemolymph. Area
      under the curve (AUC0-infinity) values lie in the order of muscle >
      hepatopancreas > hemolymph, suggesting that eugenol tends to accumulate in muscle
      by the immersion administration. Moreover, the average residence time
      (MRT0-infinity) values of 38.6, 23.0 and 115.3 h for hemolymph, hepatopancreas
      and muscle are achieved, which may indicate that hepatopancreas is the main organ
      for elimination of eugenol. After combining the conditions in a sequential bath
      immersion of eugenol (Treatment 3), the maximum concentration (Cmax) values of
      eugenol are higher than those achieved in Treatment 2, indicating that
      accumulation of eugenol happened in haemolymph, hepatopancreas and muscle. In
      addition, the corresponding t1/2z values are 4.7, 14.9 and 47.6 h, respectively, 
      suggesting the faster elimination from the tissues following sequential
      administration. After the immersion bath, eugenol concentrations in muscle of
      Pacific white shrimp are lower than 2.5 mg/kg at 2 h, 48 h and 24.5 h in
      Treatment 1 ~ 3. CONCLUSIONS: A withdrawal period of 2 h, 48 h and 24.5 h
      following a 300 mg L(- 1) of eugenol over a 5-min, 10 mg L(- 1) eugenol
      concentration during a 24-h and combined conditions in a sequential immersion
      bath were suggested.

      sibogae australis from Moreton Bay, Australia.

AB  - Wild Acetes sibogae australis from northern Moreton Bay, Australia displaying
      opacity of the hepatopancreas were sampled and examined histologically, revealing
      infection by multinucleate plasmodia of a haplosporidian-like parasite in the
      epithelial cells of the hepatopancreas. A morphological and phylogenetic
      investigation identified the parasite as a novel species of the order
      Haplosporida, and the parasite is described as Haplosporidium acetes n. sp. This 
      is the first report of disease caused by a haplosporidian in wild Australian
      decapod crustaceans, and the first record of haplosporidiosis in sergestid
      shrimp. Infections of H. acetes were observed in all cell types (R, B, F and E)
      within the hepatopancreas. Infected epithelial cells became hypertrophied as they
      filled with haplosporidian parasites and, in heavy infections, caused almost
      complete displacement of normal hepatopancreas tissue. Although sporulation was
      not observed, infected jelly prawns appeared terminally diseased. Infections
      became grossly evident in around 5% of wild prawns during early autumn at a time 
      of year when jelly prawn populations decline rapidly with decreasing water
      temperatures, however histopathology indicated at least 13% of apparently normal 
      jelly prawns were also infected. Further studies are required in order to
      determine if this parasite influences jelly prawn population dynamics. In
      addition, we report co-infection of a novel microsporidian parasite in the
      Enterocytozoon Group Microsporidia (EGM) infecting nuclei of hepatopancreatic
      epithelial cells. The microsporidian was phylogenetically distinct from
      Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP) known to infect penaeid shrimp in Asia.

AB  - Background: A longitudinal study was conducted to analyze farm characteristics,
      farm practices, and biosecurity measures that influenced the occurrence of white 
      spot disease (WSD) in shrimp farming in Rayong, Thailand. Methods: Data were
      collected using a structured interview schedule administered between October 2017
      and September 2019. A generalized estimating equations (GEE) model was used to
      identify risk factors. From the 270 responses, 86 possible risk factors were
      analyzed using univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: We found that 17
      possible risk factors were statistically significant with an alpha level of 1%
      and associated with WSD status. In the final model, multivariate analysis found
      that two independent variables were statistically significant. First, the absence
      of inclement weather during ponding was a statistically significant factor
      associated with WSD occurrence and it prevented WSD occurrence as the odds ratio 
      (OR) was <1 (OR = 0.196, P = 1.3 x 10(-5)). Second, the separation of ponds into 
      three specific types (cultured, water treatment, and pond for water reservoir)
      was significantly associated with WSD occurrence. Likewise, the presence of this 
      ponding system was a protective factor against WSD (OR = 0.0828, P = 0.001).
      Conclusions: The results of this study offer a reference for farmers and relevant
      authorities when addressing WSD occurrence in shrimp farming. In addition, our
      results can help relevant authorities in controlling WSD in other endemic areas.

TI  - An integrative re-evaluation of Typhlatya shrimp within the karst aquifer of the 
      Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico.
PG  - 5302

AB  - The Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico is a carbonate platform well-known for extensive
      karst networks of densely stratified aquifer ecosystems. This aquifer supports
      diverse anchialine fauna, including species of the globally distributed
      anchialine shrimp genus Typhlatya (Atyidae). Four species (T. campecheae, T.
      pearsei, T. dzilamensis and T. mitchelli) are endemic to the Peninsula, of which 
      three are federally listed in Mexico. This first integrative evaluation (i.e.,
      molecular, morphological, broad geographic and type locality sampling, and
      environmental data) of Yucatan Typhlatya reveals considerable species identity
      conflict in prior phylogenetic assessments, broad species ranges, syntopy within 
      cave systems and five genetic lineages (of which two are new to science). Despite
      sampling from the type locality of endangered T. campecheae, specimens (and
      molecular data) were indistinguishable from vulnerable T. pearsei.
      Ancestral/divergence reconstructions support convergent evolution of a
      low-salinity ancestor for a post-Paleogene arc Yucatan + Cuba Typhlatya clade
      within the anchialine Atyidae clade. A secondary adaptation for the
      coastal-restricted euryhaline (2-37 psu), Typhlatya dzilamensis (unknown
      conservation status) was identified, while remaining species lineages were
      low-salinity (< 5 psu) adapted and found within the meteoric lens of inland and
      coastal caves. This study demonstrates the need for integrative/interdisciplinary
      approaches when conducting biodiversity assessments in complex and poorly studied
      aquifers.

TI  - Accumulation potential of heavy metals at different growth stages of Pacific

AB  - This study compared the heavy metal concentration in water, sediment, and shrimp 
      at different growth stages of culture and subsequently evaluated the
      ecotoxicological and human health risk status. Total trace element concentration 
      in the water, sediment and shrimp ranged from not detected (ND) (Hg) to 91.05
      (Fe) mug/L, 0.01 (Hg) to 19, 246.33 (Fe) mg/kg, and ND (Hg) to 13.98 (Fe) mg/kg, 
      respectively. Toxic metals such as, Cd, Hg, and Pb in shrimps ranged from ND to
      2.11 mg/kg, ND to 0.158 mg/kg, ND to 0.088 mg/kg, and ND to 0.469 mg/kg,
      respectively. Toxic heavy metals at all the growth stages of shrimps (days of
      culture (DOC)-01 to DOC-90) were found below the maximum residual limit (MRL) of 
      0.5 mg/kg set by the European Commission (EC). Similarly, Cu, Zn, and As
      concentrations in shrimp were also far below the MRLs of 30 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, and
      76 mg/kg set by the World Health Organization and Food Safety and Standard
      Authority of India, respectively. The concentration of heavy metals increased
      from DOC-01 to DOC-90 and was positively correlated with the length and weight of
      the shrimps (p < 0.05). The risk assessment was estimated for both Indians and
      Americans and found no carcinogenic (lifetime cancer risk (LCR) < 10(-4)) and
      non-carcinogenic (THQ and TTHQ<1) health risks through consumption of shrimp
      cultured in this region. The hazard quotient (HQdermal < 1), hazard index (HI <
      1), and LCR (<10(-4)) values of the heavy metals indicated that the dermal
      absorption might not be a concern for the local fishermen and marine fish/shrimp 
      farmworkers. Water and sediment quality indices were applied to assess the
      surface water and sediment quality, and their results were found nil to low
      levels of heavy metal contamination at all the sampling sites. All heavy metals
      studied in sediments were < effect range low (ERL) and < threshold effect level
      (TEL), indicating no adverse biological effects on aquatic organisms. Therefore, 
      regular monitoring of the shrimp aquaculture system throughout the crop will
      provide evidence of heavy metals bioaccumulation in shrimps. This research will
      provide baseline data to help farmers establish the optimal aquaculture practices
      and regulatory authorities to formulate legislation and strategies to reduce
      heavy metal biomagnification in shrimps from farm to fork.

TI  - The combination of hypoxia and high temperature affects heat shock, anaerobic
      metabolism, and pentose phosphate pathway key components responses in the white
      shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei).
LID - 10.1007/s12192-022-01265-1 [doi]
AB  - Due to global warming, world water bodies have higher temperatures and lower
      oxygen concentrations that affect aquatic species including the white shrimp
      Litopenaeus vannamei. This species withstands these conditions, but the
      information of the physiological responses that allow them to survive are scarce.
      We analyzed the effects of high temperature, hypoxia, reoxygenation, and the
      combination of these factors on the relative expression of selected genes: HSF1, 
      Hsp70, p53, TIGAR, HIF-1alpha, and VEGF1-3 in gills of L. vannamei. Additionally,
      glucose, lactate, NADP, and NADPH were determined. HSF1 was up-regulated in the
      high temperature and oxygen stress conditions, but Hsp70 was up-regulated only in
      reoxygenation at both temperatures. HIF-1alpha was also up-regulated by
      reoxygenation in both temperatures. Meanwhile, the VEGF genes were not altered by
      the stress conditions, since none of them changed expression drastically. p53
      relative expression remained stable at the tested stress conditions, which
      prompts to the maintenance of antioxidant defenses. TIGAR expression was induced 
      in normoxia and hypoxia at high temperature, which induced NADPH content helping 
      to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS). Additionally, high temperature caused 
      higher glucose and lactate content in normoxia and hypoxia, indicating
      carbohydrate mobilization and a switch to anaerobic metabolism. The results
      showed that HSF1, the anaerobic metabolism and the pentose phosphate pathway
      (PPP) are crucial for the shrimp response to these abiotic stress conditions and 
      contribute to their survival.

AB  - The control of nitrogenous pollutants is a key concern in aquaculture production.
      Bacillus spp. are commonly used as probiotics in aquaculture, but only a few
      reports have focused on the simultaneous heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic 
      denitrification (SND) capacity of Bacillus sp. strains. In order to improve
      nitrogen biodegradation efficiency in the aquaculture industry, the SND capacity 
      of Bacillus sp. strains was evaluated using both individual and mixed nitrogen
      sources and different sources of organic carbon. Twelve Bacillus sp. isolates
      were screened from aquaculture pond sediments and shrimp guts for nitrogen
      biodegradation. Six strains exhibited especially efficient inorganic nitrogen
      removal capacities in media with individual and mixed nitrogen sources. These
      strains comprise K8, N2, and N5 (B. subtilis), HYS (B. albus), H4 (B.
      amyloliquefaciens), and S1 (B. velezensis). The strains grew better when the sole
      nitrogen source was NH4(+)-N, but degraded nitrogen in the following order:
      nitrite nitrogen (NO2(-)-N), ammonium nitrogen (NH4(+)-N), and nitrate nitrogen
      (NO3(-)-N). There was no associated NO2(-)-N accumulation, regardless of the
      nitrogen source. The optimal carbon source for nitrogen removal varied based on
      different nitrogen sources and associated metabolic pathways. The optimal carbon 
      sources for the removal of NO3(-)-N, NO2(-)-N, and NH4(+)-N were sodium citrate, 
      sodium acetate, and sucrose, respectively. The application of H4 in recirculating
      aquaculture water further demonstrated that NO2(-)-N and NH4(+)-N could be
      effectively removed. This study thus provides valuable technical support for the 
      bioremediation of aquaculture water.

TI  - Analysis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in surface sediments and
      edible aquatic species in an oil-contaminated mangrove ecosystem in Bodo, Niger
      Delta, Nigeria: Bioaccumulation and human health risk assessment.

AB  - This work investigated the occurrence and risks associated with polycyclic
      aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in tissues from five commonly consumed aquatic
      species (swimming crabs, estuarine shrimp, tiger prawns, periwinkles, and
      tilapia) and sediment across six sites in the area around Bodo town, in the Niger
      Delta region of Nigeria. We aimed to establish a relationship between PAH
      concentrations in sediment and biota, and to derive biota-sediment accumulation
      factors (BSAFs). Risks to human health associated with consumption of impacted
      food sources were assessed based on measured biotic concentrations of PAHs. The
      average concentration of PAHs and the number of PAHs measured above the limit of 
      quantification varied greatly between different biota, with the lowest average
      concentrations observed in tilapia, followed by tiger prawns, crabs, estuarine
      shrimp, and the highest concentrations were observed in periwinkles. Similar to
      biotic concentrations, BSAFs were found to vary greatly across species, sites,
      and PAHs, though BSAFs for all organisms except periwinkles were below a value of
      1. In periwinkles, BSAFs exceeded a value of 1 for phenanthrene (BSAF = 1.7),
      pyrene (1.5) and benzo[k]fluoranthene (1.7). Risks to human health associated
      with consumption of these species were assessed using the BaP toxic-equivalent
      approach for cancer risks and the toxic unit approach which jointly considered
      carcinogenic but also non-cancer hazards. The BaP toxic-equivalent approach
      showed that the excess lifetime cancer risk resulting from daily consumption of
      0.2 kg of seafood ranged between 1.3 x 10(-6) for tiger prawn and tilapia to 4.1 
      x 10(-6) for periwinkles, which is below the excess lifetime cancer risk of
      10(-4) used by Dutch and Nigerian authorities for sediment intervention values.
      This finding is supported by the results obtained from the toxic unit approach
      which indicates that the ratios of the estimated dose and the maximal permissible
      risk level for summed PAHs never exceeded 1.

AB  - The environmental accumulation of thiamethoxam has increasingly become a risk for
      the health of aquatic animals, especially crustacean species in the same phylum
      as the target pests. The lack of knowledge on the toxicity of thiamethoxam to
      crustaceans motivates our research to study the acute and chronic toxicity of
      decapod crustaceans Litopenaeus vannamei, exposed to thiamethoxam. A 28-day
      chronic toxicity test followed a 96 h acute toxicity test. Thiamethoxam induced
      oxidative stress and decreased growth performance in shrimp. In addition,
      thiamethoxam has led to a substantial imbalance of the micro-ecosystem in the
      intestine. The composition of the intestinal flora changed significantly, and the
      balance of the interaction network in genera was broken. The competitive
      interaction of many bacteria becomes an unstable cooperative interaction.
      Transcriptomic analysis showed that the numbers of up- and down-regulated
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) increased in a dose-dependent manner. These
      DEGs were significantly enriched in pathways related to detoxification, and the
      expression of most detoxification genes was upregulated. DEGs related to
      detoxification were positively correlated with Shimia and negatively correlated
      with Pseudoalteromonas. This study provides evidence for the first time on the
      toxic effects of thiamethoxam on the growth, biochemistry, intestinal flora, and 
      transcriptome in crustaceans.

AB  - Background: Herbal plants are a natural source of novel biomolecules used widely 
      in ethnomedicine. The present study was intended to examine the antimicrobial
      properties, cytotoxicity, and phytoconstituents of Ocimum americanum L., an herb 
      traditionally used by the people of Swahili (Kenya) against microbial infections.
      Methods: The aerial parts of Ocimum americanum L. were sourced, dried, milled,
      and extracted using three solvents: aqueous, acetonic, and 70% hydroethanolic.
      Additionally, fractions of chloroform and ethyl acetate were obtained from all
      crude extracts of the plant. The antimicrobial property was evaluated using agar 
      well diffusion and microdilution techniques against human opportunistic pathogens
      including S. aureus, E. coli, and C. albicans. The brine shrimp cytotoxicity test
      was used to analyze the lethality of the extracts and fractions. Phytochemical
      screening was used to qualitatively assay the presence of phytoconstituents.
      Results: The phytochemical assay confirmed the presence of alkaloids, phenols,
      flavonoids, tannins, saponins, terpenoids, reducing sugars, anthraquinones, and
      glycosides. The lethality test demonstrated that all the extracts and fractions
      were toxic against Artemia salina nauplii with LC50 values ranging from 0.59 to
      559.71 microg/ml. Chloroformic fraction of the hydroethanolic extract had the
      highest lethality with an LC50 value of 0.59 microg/ml. Two of the extracts and
      their fractions displayed antimicrobial activity against the Gram-positive
      bacteria (B. cereus and S. aureus) and fungus (C. albicans), while the same
      extracts had no activity against the Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli and K.
      pneumoniae). The highest antimicrobial activity was seen in the ethyl acetate
      fraction of the hydroethanolic extract at 250 mg/ml against Bacillus cereus which
      had an inhibition zone of 26.00 +/- 0.00 and MIC value of 62.5 mg/ml. Conclusion:
      In the current study, we report that Ocimum americanum L. demonstrated moderate
      antimicrobial activity, contains numerous phytocompounds, and is highly
      cytotoxic; thus, further research is needed for bioprospecting a novel compound.

AB  - Marinobacter is a genus belonging to the class Gammaproteobacteria and the family
      Alteromonadaceae. This genus is a Gram-negative bacterium which can be found in a
      wide range of marine and saline water environments. Here, we present the genome
      sequence of Marinobacter sp. strain CA1 that was isolated from the indigenous
      diatom found in the whiteleg shrimp, Penaeus vannamei (Bonne 1931) pond in
      Malaysia. Genome sequencing was done using Pacbio and Illumina sequencing
      platforms. De novo hybrid assembly based on Pacbio long reads and high quality
      Illumina short reads yielded a complete circular chromosome with 4.7 M base pair 
      (bp) in size. This genome was submitted to Genbank, NCBI database and can be
      accessed under accession number: NZ_CP071785 and the BioProject acession number
      PRJNA710741. This data could be useful for other studies on microalgae and
      bacteria interaction, and comparative genomics analysis of other Marinobacter
      species.

AB  - Water quality is essential for successful aquaculture. For freshwater shrimp
      farming, ammonia concentrations can increase considerably, even when culture
      water is renewed frequently, consequently increasing the risk of ammonia
      intoxication. We investigated ammonia lethality (LC50-96 h) in a hololimnetic
      population of the Amazon River shrimp Macrobrachium amazonicum from the
      Parana/Paraguay River basin, including the effects of exposure to 4.93 mg L(-1)
      total ammonia concentration on gill (Na(+), K(+))-ATPase activity. The mean
      LC50-96 h was 49.27 mg L(-1) total ammonia, corresponding to 1.8 mg L(-1)
      un-ionized ammonia. Except for NH4(+) affinity that increased 2.5-fold, that of
      the gill (Na(+), K(+))-ATPase for ATP, Mg(2+), Na(+), K(+) and ouabain was
      unchanged after ammonia exposure. Western blotting of gill microsomal
      preparations from fresh caught shrimps showed a single immunoreactive band of
      approximately 110 kDa, corresponding to the gill (Na(+), K(+))-ATPase
      alpha-subunit. Ammonia exposure increased (Na(+), K(+))-ATPase activity by
      approximately 25%, coincident with an additional 130 kDa alpha-subunit
      immunoreactive band, and increased K(+)-stimulated and V(H(+))-ATPase activities 
      by approximately 2.5-fold. Macrobrachium amazonicum from the Parana/Paraguay
      River basin is as tolerant to ammonia as are other Amazon River basins
      populations, showing toxicity comparable to that of marine crustaceans.

AB  - Intelectins are immune lectins expressed in chordates, including several fish
      species, in which intelectins are known to be upregulated upon infection.
      However, the basic biochemical properties and bacteria binding specificities of
      several fish intelectins are not well studied. We focus our investigation on
      zebrafish intelectin-2 (DrIntL-2) that is predominantly expressed in the
      gastrointestinal tract. The disulfide-linked oligomeric state and the cysteine
      responsible for intermolecular disulfide bonds are identified. DrIntL-2 is a
      globular particle of around 30 nm. In addition to the typical exocyclic 1,2-diol 
      ligands, DrIntL-2 binds beta-1,3-glucan and recognizes Salmonella typhimurium and
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This investigation not only shed light on the fish innate
      immunity that will be essential for the aquaculture industry, but will also
      provide a foundation for further application of DrIntL-2 in bacteria detection
      and identification.

AB  - The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence of two
      fermentation temperatures (10 degrees C and 20 degrees C) on the physicochemical 
      properties and bacterial community composition of the low-salt shrimp paste. The 
      physicochemical properties pH values, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVBN), amino
      acid nitrogen (AAN) and biogenic amines (BAs) of low-salt shrimp paste were
      analyzed and compared. The bacterial community composition was analyzed by
      high-throughput sequencing technology. Results indicate that the pH value
      fluctuated between 8.50 and 7.95, and the AAN, TVBN and total BAs levels of
      low-salt shrimp paste increased gradually after fermentation started, but the AAN
      content fluctuated steadily after 12 w. The contents of TVBN and total BAs in
      shrimp paste fermented at 10 degrees C were lower than those at 20 degrees C.
      Thus, the appropriate fermentation temperature and period were 10 degrees C and
      12 w, respectively. Carnobacteriaceae and Staphylococaceae were the predominant
      family for the fermented shrimp paste. At the genus level, Alkalibacterium was
      predominantly present at 8 wk (96.36%), while Staphylococcus became the
      predominant one at 20 wk (58.71%). Correlation analysis shows that
      Alkalibacterium was positively associated with tyramine (R(2) = 0.59), and
      Staphylococcus and Tetragenococcus were positively associated with AAN and TVBN. 
      These findings are used to facilitate the quality control and improvement of
      low-salt shrimp paste production process in the future.

LID - 10.3390/v14030585 [doi]
AB  - Shrimp is one of the most valuable aquaculture species globally, and the most
      internationally traded seafood product. Consequently, shrimp aquaculture
      practices have received increasing attention due to their high value and levels
      of demand, and this has contributed to economic growth in many developing
      countries. The global production of shrimp reached approximately 6.5 million t in
      2019 and the shrimp aquaculture industry has consequently become a large-scale
      operation. However, the expansion of shrimp aquaculture has also been accompanied
      by various disease outbreaks, leading to large losses in shrimp production. Among
      the diseases, there are various viral diseases which can cause serious damage
      when compared to bacterial and fungi-based illness. In addition, new viral
      diseases occur rapidly, and existing diseases can evolve into new types. To
      address this, the review presented here will provide information on the DNA and
      RNA of shrimp viral diseases that have been designated by the World Organization 
      for Animal Health and identify the latest shrimp disease trends.

TI  - Potentially Toxic Metals in the High-Biomass Non-Hyperaccumulating Plant
      Amaranthus viridis: Human Health Risks and Phytoremediation Potentials.
LID - 389 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biology11030389 [doi]
AB  - Human health risk and phytoremediation of potentially toxic metals (PTMs) in the 
      edible vegetables have been widely discussed recently. This study aimed to
      determine the concentrations of four PTMs, namely Cd, Fe, Ni, and Zn) in
      Amaranthus viridis (leaves, stems, and roots) collected from 11 sampling sites in
      Peninsular Malaysia and to assess their human health risk (HHR). In general, the 
      metal levels followed the order: roots &gt; stems &gt; leaves. The metal
      concentrations (microg/g) in the leaves of A. viridis ranged from 0.45 to 2.18
      dry weight (dw) (0.05-0.26 wet weight (ww)), 74.8 to 535 dw (8.97-64.2 ww), 2.02 
      to 7.45 dw (0.24-0.89 ww), and 65.2 to 521 dw (7.83-62.6 ww), for Cd, Fe, Ni, and
      Zn, respectively. The positive relationships between the metals, the plant parts,
      and the geochemical factions of their habitat topsoils indicated the potential of
      A. viridis as a good biomonitor of Cd, Fe, and Ni pollution. With most of the
      values of the bioconcentration factor (BCF) &gt; 1.0 and the transfer factor (TF)
      &gt; 1.0, A. viridis was a very promising phytoextraction agent of Ni and Zn.
      Additionally, with most of the values of BCF &gt; 1.0 and TF &lt; 1.0, A. viridis
      was a very promising phytostabiliser of Cd and Fe. With respect to HHR, the
      target hazard quotients (THQ) for Cd, Fe, Pb, and Zn in the leaves of A. viridis 
      were all below 1.00, indicating there were no non-carcinogenic risks of the four 
      metals to consumers, including children and adults. Nevertheless, routine
      monitoring of PTMs in Amaranthus farms is much needed.

TI  - Screening of the Toxicity of Polystyrene Nano- and Microplastics Alone and in
      Combination with Benzo(a)pyrene in Brine Shrimp Larvae and Zebrafish Embryos.
LID - 941 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nano12060941 [doi]
AB  - The occurrence of nanoplastics (NPs) and microplastics (MPs) in aquatic
      ecosystems and their capacity to sorb hydrophobic pollutants is nowadays an issue
      of great concern. This study aimed to assess the potential bioavailability and
      acute toxicity of polystyrene (PS) NPs (50 and 500 nm) and of MPs (4.5 microm),
      alone and with sorbed benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P), in the embryo/larval stages of
      brine shrimps and zebrafish. Exposure to pristine plastics up to 50.1 mg PS/L did
      not cause significant impact on brine shrimp survival, while some treatments of
      plastics-B(a)P and all concentrations of B(a)P (0.1-10 mg/L) resulted acutely
      toxic. In zebrafish, only the highest concentrations of MPs-B(a)P and B(a)P
      caused a significant increase of malformation prevalence. Ingestion of NPs was
      observed by 24-48 h of exposure in the two organisms (from 0.069 to 6.87 mg
      PS/L). In brine shrimps, NPs were observed over the body surface and within the
      digestive tract, associated with feces. In zebrafish, NPs were localized in the
      eyes, yolk sac, and tail at 72 h, showing their capacity to translocate and
      spread into the embryo. MP ingestion was only demonstrated for brine shrimps. In 
      zebrafish embryos exposed to plastics-B(a)P, B(a)P appeared in the yolk sac of
      the embryos. The presence of B(a)P was also noticeable in brine shrimps exposed
      to 500 nm NPs-B(a)P. In conclusion, NPs entered and spread into the zebrafish
      embryo and PS NPs, and MPs were successful vectors of B(a)P to brine shrimp and
      zebrafish embryos. Particle size played a significant role in explaining the
      toxicity of plastics-B(a)P. Our study provides support for the idea that plastics
      may pose a risk to aquatic organisms when combined with persistent organic
      pollutants such as B(a)P.

TI  - Isolation and Identification of Bioactive Compounds from Bidens spp. Using
      HPLC-DAD and GC-MS Analysis and Their Biological Activity as Anticancer
      Molecules.
LID - 1927 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27061927 [doi]
AB  - The genus Bidens a member of family Compositae, is widely documented as an
      ethno-medicinally important genus of plants. In the present study, anticancer
      potential of three ethno-medicinally important species i.e., B. bipinnata, B.
      biternata and B. pilosa were tested. For in-vitro evaluation, an MTT (Thiazolyl
      blue tetrazolium bromide) assay was performed against cervical cancer cells
      (HeLa), hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG), and adenocarcinoma human alveolar basal 
      epithelial cells (A549). For in vivo evaluation, Artemia salina, Danio rerio, and
      Caenorhabditis elegans were used. Among all the tested extracts, the ethanol
      extract of B. biternata appeared to have highest anticancer activity, and the
      compounds responsible for this activity were identified to be Tris
      (2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl), 4-hydroxy-2,4'-dimethoxychalcone, and
      2,4-di-tert-butylphenol. This is the first report of the isolation of Tris
      (2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphate from the genus Bidens and the first report of
      4-hydroxy-2,4'-dimethoxychalcone and 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol from B. biternata.
      Among the isolated compounds, 4-hydroxy-2,4'-dimethoxychalcone showed the highest
      anticancer activity with an LD50 value of 236.7 microg/mL. Therefore, this
      compound carries promising potential for being established as a pharmaceutical
      for chemoprevention and chemotherapy.

TI  - The Role of Insulin-like Peptide in Maintaining Hemolymph Glucose Homeostasis in 
      the Pacific White Shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei.
LID - 3268 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23063268 [doi]
AB  - Insulin-like peptide (ILP) has been identified in various crustaceans, but
      whether it has a similar function in regulating hemolymph glucose as vertebrate
      insulin is unclear. We analyzed the components of hemolymph sugar in the Pacific 
      white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, and investigated the changes of hemolymph
      glucose concentration and the expressions of ILP and glucose metabolism genes
      under different treatments. We found glucose was a major component of hemolymph
      sugar in shrimp. Starvation caused hemolymph glucose to rise first and then
      decline, and the raised hemolymph glucose after exogenous glucose injection
      returned to basal levels within a short time, indicating that shrimp have a
      regulatory mechanism to maintain hemolymph glucose homeostasis. In addition,
      injections of bovine insulin and recombinant LvILP protein both resulted in a
      fast decline in hemolymph glucose. Notably, RNA interference of LvILP did not
      significantly affect hemolymph glucose levels, but it inhibited exogenous glucose
      clearance. Based on the detection of glucose metabolism genes, we found LvILP
      might maintain hemolymph glucose stability by regulating the expression of these 
      genes. These results suggest that ILP has a conserved function in shrimp similar 
      to insulin in vertebrates and plays an important role in maintaining hemolymph
      glucose homeostasis.

TI  - Nature-Inspired Antimicrobial Surfaces and Their Potential Applications in Food
      Industries.
LID - 844 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/foods11060844 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global concern and has called for the
      integration of different areas of expertise for designing robust solutions. One
      such approach is the development of antimicrobial surfaces to combat the emerging
      resistance in microbes against drugs and disinfectants. This review is a
      compressive summary of the work done in the field of material science, chemistry,
      and microbiology in the development of antimicrobial materials and surfaces that 
      are inspired by examples in nature. The focus includes examples of natural
      antimicrobial surfaces, such as cicada wings or nanopillars, dragonfly wings,
      shrimp shells, taro leaves, lotus leaves, sharkskin, gecko skin, and butterfly
      wings, along with their mechanism of action. Techniques, compositions, and
      combinations that have been developed to synthetically mimic these surfaces
      against bacterial/viral and fungal growth in food-processing areas have also been
      discussed. The applications of synthetic mimics of natural antimicrobial surfaces
      in food-processing environments is still a naive area of research. However, this 
      review highlights the potential applications of natural antimicrobial surfaces in
      the food-processing environment as well as outlines the challenges that need
      mitigations.

TI  - (+/-)-Catechin-A Mass-Spectrometry-Based Exploration Coordination Complex
      Formation with Fe(II) and Fe(III).
LID - 958 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cells11060958 [doi]
AB  - Catechin is an extensively investigated plant flavan-3-ol with a beneficial
      impact on human health that is often associated with antioxidant activities and
      iron coordination complex formation. The aim of this study was to explore these
      properties with Fe(II) and Fe(III) using a combination of nanoelectrospray-mass
      spectrometry, differential pulse voltammetry, site-specific deoxyribose
      degradation assay, Fe(II) autoxidation assay, and brine shrimp mortality assay.
      Catechin primarily favored coordination complex formation with Fe ions of the
      stoichiometry catechin:Fe in the ratio of 1:1 or 2:1. In the detected Fe-catechin
      coordination complexes, Fe(II) prevailed. Differential pulse voltammetry, the
      site-specific deoxyribose degradation, and Fe(II) autoxidation assays proved that
      coordination complex formation affected catechin's antioxidant effects. In situ
      formed Fe-catechin coordination complexes showed no toxic activities in the brine
      shrimp mortality assay. In summary, catechin has properties for the possible
      treatment of pathological processes associated with ageing and degeneration, such
      as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.

AB  - Plant culture integration within aquaculture activities is a topic of recent
      interest with economic and environmental benefits. Shrimp farming activities
      generate nutrient-rich waste trapped in the sediments of farming ponds or release
      in the mangrove area. Thus, we investigate if the halophytes species naturally
      growing around the pond can use nitrogen and carbon from shrimp farming for
      remediation purposes. Halophyte biomasses and sediments influenced by shrimp farm
      effluents, were collected in two farms in New-Caledonia. All samples were
      analyzed for their C and N stable isotopic composition and N content. Higher
      delta(15)N values were found in plants influenced by shrimp farm water thus
      evidenced their abilities to take nutrient derived from shrimp farming. Deep root
      species Chenopodium murale, Atriplex jubata, Suaeda australis and Enchylaena
      tomentosa appears more efficient for shrimp pond remediation. This work
      demonstrates that halophytes cultivation in shrimp ponds with sediments, could be
      effective for the pond's remediation.

TI  - Duplex droplet digital PCR method for the detection of Enterocytozoon
      hepatopenaei and Vibrio parahaemolyticus acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease.
PG  - 761-769
LID - 10.1111/jfd.13600 [doi]
AB  - Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP) and Vibrio parahaemolyticus acute
      hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (VPAHPND) are two of the diseases that have
      frequently infected farmed shrimp in recent years, causing great economic losses 
      to the shrimp industry worldwide. In this study, we established a sensitive and
      accurate duplex droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) method that can simultaneously detect
      and quantify the two pathogens simultaneously. The results showed that the ddPCR 
      methods could detect EHP and VPAHPND specifically. The sensitivity levels of
      ddPCR for EHP and VPAHPND were 2.3 copies/mul and 4.6 copies/mul, respectively,
      which were 10-fold higher than the sensitivity of the qPCR assay and showed good 
      reproducibility. Twenty-six suspected diseased shrimp samples were used for
      practical determination. For EHP, the detection rates of ddPCR and qPCR were
      53.84% and 42.31%, respectively; for VPAHPND, the detection rates of ddPCR and
      qPCR were both 23.08%. The results indicated that the ddPCR method shows
      superiority for detection in samples with low viral loads, which will facilitate 
      monitoring of the source and transmission of EHP and VPAHPND and will help
      control shrimp epidemic disease.

TI  - Bioconversion of chitin waste through Stenotrophomonas maltophilia for production
      of chitin derivatives as a Seabass enrichment diet.
PG  - 4792
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-08371-1 [doi]
AB  - Marine wastes pose a great threat to the ecosystem leading to severe
      environmental hazards and health issues particularly the shellfish wastes. The
      shellfish waste which contains half of the amount of chitin can be efficiently
      transformed into useful products. Various approaches for the hydrolysis of chitin
      like physical, chemical, and enzymatic processes are there. Still, the use of
      enzyme chitinase is well documented as an effective and eco-friendly method. The 
      present study summarizes the isolation of chitinase enzyme producing bacteria
      from different shrimp waste disposal sites in Parangipettai (India), and the
      possible use of an enzyme hydrolyzate as an immunostimulant to Asian Seabass
      (Lates calcarifer). The potential chitinase-producing bacteria were identified by
      16S rRNA gene sequencing as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. After purification, the
      chitinase specific activity was 5.01 (U/ml) and the protein content was 72 mg and
      the recovery rate was 48.06%. The optimum pH and temperature for the chitinolytic
      activity were 6.5 and at 35-50 degrees C, respectively. The animal experiment
      trial was done with our feed supplements which included 0.0 (control), 0.5%, 1%
      and 2% of chitin degraded product. All the supplementary feed had an optimal 42% 
      (w/w) of crude protein. The feed protein level was 41-43% on average and gross
      energy was 13-17 kcal/g and the feed was observed to exhibit a significantly
      higher (p < 0.05) survival rate, condition factor, specific growth rates, and
      body weight gain was also found to be promising compared to other fishes fed with
      control diet only. The red blood cells (RBC) and white blood cell (WBC) counts
      were found to increase significantly after being challenged with infection in
      animals fed with chitin derivatives from 1st week to 3rd week when compared to
      the control. The hematocrit (Hct) values were low on the 2nd and 3rd week in
      infected fish fed with chitin derivatives. This low level was due to infection
      lyses of the red blood cells and increased nitro blue tetrazolium reduction. The 
      control diet-fed fish showed 70% mortality but the chitin derivative supplemented
      fishes showed only 20% mortality post-infection. The results of the study
      encompass that the use of chitin-derivate enriched feed further is taken into
      large-scale approaches thereby benefitting the aquaculture sector.

TI  - Effects of shrimp oil on cardio-metabolic risk factors in children and
      adolescents.
LID - 10.1024/0300-9831/a000755 [doi]
AB  - Background: Antioxidants have beneficial effects on health. Shrimp oil has
      Astaxanthin and omega 3 that act as powerful antioxidants and might have
      anti-inflammatory effects on cardiovascular diseases. This study aims to
      investigate the effects of shrimp oil supplementation on cardio-metabolic risk
      factors in overweight and obese children and adolescents. Methods: This
      randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted on 64
      overweight and obese participants with 10-18 years of age. They were randomly
      assigned to receive either 500 mg shrimp oil or identical placebo that contained 
      medium-chain triglycerides once per day for eight weeks. Dietary intake was
      obtained using food record questionnaire for three days at baseline and at the
      end of the study. Fasting blood samples were obtained at baseline and after eight
      weeks of intervention. Results: Overall, 53 participants completed the study; 30 
      subjects received shrimp oil and 23 subjects received placebo. There were no
      significant effects of shrimp oil on total cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL-C,
      LDL-C and blood pressure compared with the placebo group (p>0.05). Shrimp oil had
      no significant effects on body mass index, waist circumference and hip
      circumference compared with the placebo group (p>0.05). Conclusions:
      Supplementation with shrimp oil had no significant effects on improving the
      anthropometric measures and cardio-metabolic risk factors. Future clinical trials
      are needed to investigate the beneficial effects of higher doses of shrimp oil on
      cardio-metabolic risk factors in the pediatric age groups.

AB  - A comprehensive lipidomic analysis of the lipids extracted from grass carp bones,
      black carp bones, shrimp shells, and crab shells was performed in this study.
      First, HPLC analysis revealed that the lipids extracted from shrimp and crab
      shells contained 60.65% and 77.25% of diacylglycerols, respectively. Second,
      GC-MS analysis identified 18 fatty acid species in the lipids extracted from fish
      bones and crustacean shells, in which polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were
      highly enriched. PUFAs were present at 45.43% in the lipids extracted from shrimp
      shells. Notably, the lipids extracted from shrimp and crab shells contained a
      considerable amount of eicosapentaenoic acids and docosahexaenoic acids. Finally,
      multidimensional mass spectrometry-based shotgun lipidomics showed that various
      lipids including acetyl-L-carnitine, sphingomyelin (SM), lysophosphatidylcholine,
      and phosphatidylcholine (PC) were all identified in the lipid samples, but PC and
      SM were the most abundant. Specifically, the total content of PC in shrimp shells
      was as high as 6.145 mmol/g. More than 35 species of PC were found in all
      samples, which were more than other lipids. This study is expected to provide a
      scientific basis for the application of freshwater fish bones and crustacean
      shells in food, medicine, and other fields.

TI  - Paragonimiasis diagnosed by CT-guided transthoracic lung biopsy: Literature
      review and case report.
PG  - 1591-1597
LID - 10.1016/j.radcr.2022.02.046 [doi]
AB  - More than 40 different species of the parasitic flatworm Paragonimus have been
      identified worldwide, including in Vietnam, but only 10 species are known to
      cause disease in humans, particularly Paragonimus westermani. Paragonimus are
      transmitted through the ingestion of raw foods, especially freshwater shrimp, and
      crab. Paragonimiasis causes pneumonia, which can present as acute or chronic,
      with symptoms including prolonged cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, and
      hemoptysis. Hematologic changes include eosinophilia and the presence of specific
      antibodies for Paragonimus in the blood. Diagnosis is confirmed when Paragonimus 
      specimens or eggs are found in the sputum or pleural fluid. The specificity of
      imaging is not high, but imaging can be used to guide the diagnosis. After the
      failure of microbiological diagnostic methods, lung biopsy can be used to confirm
      a diagnosis of paragonimiasis. We present a paragonimiasis case associated with
      unique features, including epidemiologic factors, atypical clinical signs, no
      increases in blood eosinophils, and negative microbiological tests. Although the 
      patient was suspected of tuberculosis or lung cancer, imaging studies were
      consistent with the presence of lung flukes. Three transthoracic lung biopsies
      were performed, and pathology revealed a cystic structure containing Paragonimus 
      on the third biopsy.

TI  - Sedimentary Nitrogen and Sulfur Reduction Functional-Couplings Interplay With the
      Microbial Community of Anthropogenic Shrimp Culture Pond Ecosystem.
PG  - 830777
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.830777 [doi]
AB  - Sediment nitrogen and sulfur cycles are essential biogeochemical processes that
      regulate the microbial communities of environmental ecosystems, which have
      closely linked to environment ecological health. However, their functional
      couplings in anthropogenic aquaculture sedimentary ecosystems remain poorly
      understood. Here, we explored the sediment functional genes in shrimp culture
      pond ecosystems (SCPEs) at different culture stages using the GeoChip gene array 
      approach with 16S amplicon sequencing. Dissimilarity analysis showed that the
      compositions of both functional genes and bacterial communities differed at
      different phases of shrimp culture with the appearance of temporal distance decay
      (p < 0.05). During shrimp culture, the abundances of nitrite and sulfite
      reduction functional genes decreased (p < 0.05), while those of nitrate and
      sulfate reduction genes were enriched (p < 0.05) in sediments, implying the
      enrichment of nitrites and sulfites from microbial metabolism. Meanwhile,
      nitrogen and sulfur reduction genes were found to be linked with carbon
      degradation and phosphorous metabolism (p < 0.05). The influence pathways of
      nutrients were demonstrated by structural equation modeling through environmental
      factors and the bacterial community on the nitrogen and sulfur reduction
      functions, indicating that the bacterial community response to environmental
      factors was facilitated by nutrients, and led to the shifts of functional genes
      (p < 0.05). These results indicate that sediment nitrogen and sulfur reduction
      functions in SCPEs were coupled, which are interconnected with the SCPEs
      bacterial community. Our findings will be helpful for understanding
      biogeochemical cycles in anthropogenic aquaculture ecosystems and promoting
      sustainable management of sediment environments through the framework of an
      ecological perspective.

AB  - A UPLC-MS/MS method was developed for the detection of tropomyosin (TM) in shrimp
      and crab. After simple extraction, the samples were purified by immunoaffinity
      column and then digested by trypsin. The obtained sample was separated by
      Easy-nLC 1000-Q Exactive. The obtained spectrums were analyzed by Thermo Proteome
      Discoverer 1.4 software and then ANIQLVEK with high sensitivity was selected as
      the quantitative signature peptide. Isotope-labeled internal standard was used in
      the quantitative analysis. The method showed good linearity in the range of
      5-5,000 mug/L with a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.1 mg/kg. The average
      recoveries were 77.22-95.66% with RSDs </= 9.97%, and the matrix effects were
      between 88.53 and 112.60%. This method could be used for rapid screening and
      quantitative analysis of TM in shrimp and crab. Thus, it could provide technical 
      support for self-testing of TM by food manufacturers and promote further
      improvement of allergen labeling in China.

TI  - Comparison of lipid metabolism between broodstock and hybrid offspring in the
      hepatopancreas of juvenile shrimp (Macrobrachium nipponense): Response to chronic
      ammonia stress.

AB  - Ammonia nitrogen is a major pollutant that causes great physiological harm to
      crustaceans in culture. In this study, we conducted a 28 day chronic ammonia
      nitrogen stress experiment with broodstock populations (Dianshan, DS) and hybrid 
      offspring populations (DS female symbol x CD (Changjiang male symbol x Dongting
      female symbol), SCD) exposed to 0, 1 and 10 mg/L of ammonia concentrations. A 28 
      day feeding trial and chronic ammonia nitrogen stress were used to investigate
      the effects on the growth performance, histological structure and lipid
      metabolism of juvenile shrimp, Macrobrachium nipponense. Our results indicated
      that survival rates in the SCD groups were significantly higher than those in the
      DS groups, whereas weight and length gain rates were not significantly different 
      between the groups (p > 0.05). Histological structure results showed that the
      number of vacuoles in the DS group was significantly higher than that in the SCD 
      group and hepatopancreas cell structures were disrupted in the ammonia treatment 
      groups. The results of oil red staining showed that the number of lipid droplets 
      increased significantly with the increase in ammonia concentration. As the
      ammonia concentration increased, fatty acid contents, lipid enzyme activities and
      lipid metabolism-related gene expression all tended to rise. In conclusion,
      ammonia nitrogen exposure caused damage to the hepatopancreas structure of
      juvenile shrimp and disturbed the lipid metabolism of the hepatopancreas. In
      addition, the SCD population had stronger stress resistance than the DS
      population when subjected to the same concentration of ammonia nitrogen stress.

AB  - The present study evaluated the growth performance, digestive enzyme activity,
      non-specific immunity, immunity and growth genes in Penaeus vannamei fed diets
      supplemented with Bovine lactoferricin (the basal diet without Bovine
      lactoferricin, the control; 1.0 per thousand Bovine lactoferricinLCB1; 1.5 per
      thousand Bovine lactoferricinLCB1.5; 2.0 per thousand Bovine lactoferricin, LCB2;
      2.5 per thousand Bovine lactoferricin, LCB2.5) for 56 days. The feeding trial
      showed that the final weight, weight gain rate, and specific growth rate of the
      shrimp were improved significantly, while the feed conversion ratio was reduced
      significantly in the LCB1.5 group compared to the control (P < 0.05). The
      challenge test of Vibrio parahaemolyticus showed that the cumulative mortalities 
      of shrimp in the LCB1.5, LCB2 and LCB2.5 groups were significantly lower than
      that in the control (P < 0.05). Compared with the control, Lipase and Trypsin
      activities in the hepatopancreas of LCB1.5 and LCB2 groups were significantly
      enhanced (P < 0.05). Compared with the control, alkaline phosphatase, acid
      phosphatase activities in the hepatopancreas and the relative expression levels
      of Relish, Toll, JAK, STAT, TOR, Raptor, 4E-BP, eIF4E1alpha, eIF4E2 genes in the 
      hepatopancreas of LCB1.5, LCB2 and LCB2.5 groups were all significantly enhanced 
      (P < 0.05). These results suggested that dietary Bovine lactoferricin could
      improve the growth performance, digestive capacity and immune responses of
      shrimp. When resistance against Vibrio parahaemolyticus in shrimp is considered, 
      high dosage of Bovine lactoferricin showed a better effect than low dosage of
      Bovine lactoferricin. However, high dosage of Bovine lactoferricin can have a
      negative impact on the growth performance of shrimp. Considering collectively the
      above, Bovine lactoferricin could improve the growth performance, digestive
      enzymes activities, immune responses and disease resistance of P. vannamei.

TI  - Bioactive secondary metabolites from Trichoderma viride MM21: structure
      elucidation, molecular docking and biological activity.
LID - 10.1515/znc-2021-0284 [doi]
AB  - Four bioactive metabolites; ergosterol (1), peroxy ergosterol (2),
      alpha-cyclopiazonic acid (3) and kojic acid (4), were isolated from the fungal
      sp. Trichoderma viride MM21. Their structures were assigned by cumulative
      analysis of NMR and mass spectra, and comparison with literature. The
      antimicrobial activity of the fungus supernatant, mycelial cake, cumulative crude
      extract and compounds 1-4 was broadly studied against 11 diverse pathogens,
      revealing auspicious activity results. Based on the molecular docking, ergosterol
      (1) and peroxy ergosterol (2) were picked up to be computationally tested against
      topoisomerase IV of Staphylococcus aureus. The nominated enzyme is a possible
      target for the antibacterial activity of triterpenoidal/steroidal compounds.
      Compounds 1, 2 showed a deep inserting inside the enzyme groove recording a good 
      binding affinity of -8.1 and -8.4 kcal/mol, respectively. Noteworthy that the
      antibacterial activity of ergosterol was higher (14-17 mm) than peroxy ergosterol
      (11-14 mm), although ergosterol formed only one hydrogen bond with the target,
      while peroxy ergosterol formed three hydrogen bonds. Such higher antibacterial
      activity of ergosterol may be attributed to its interference with other proteins 
      included in this inhibition. The cytotoxic activity was tested against brine
      shrimp, revealing 100% mortality for the supernatant, crude extract and whole
      isolated compounds. Such strong cytotoxicity is attributed most likely to the
      abundant productivity/concentration of alpha-cyclopiazonic acid and kojic acid.

TI  - Comparison of immune defense and antioxidant capacity between broodstock and
      hybrid offspring of juvenile shrimp (Macrobrachium nipponense): Response to acute
      ammonia stress.
PG  - 380-392
LID - 10.1111/age.13182 [doi]
AB  - Ammonia is a major environmental pollutant in the aquatic system that poses a
      great threat to the health of shrimp. Macrobrachium nipponense, as one of the
      large-yield farmed shrimp, is facing germplasm degradation. Genetic improvement
      through hybridization is one of the effective methods to solve this problem.
      However, there are few studies on the effects of ammonia nitrogen on the
      germplasm resources of M. nipponense. In this study, the broodstock populations
      (Dianshan, DS) and hybrid offspring (DS female symbol x CD [Changjiang, CJ male
      symbol x Dongting, DT female symbol], SCD) were exposed to 0, 5, or 20 mg/L of
      ammonia for 96 h. The survival rate of the SCD group was greater than the DS
      group, although there were no significant differences in weight gain rate and
      length gain rate (p > 0.05). The number of positive cells and apoptosis rates in 
      the DS group were significantly greater than in the SCD group after ammonia
      exposure (p < 0.05). As the ammonia concentration increased, the antioxidant
      enzyme activities in the SCD group were significantly higher than DS group, while
      the hepatotoxicity enzyme activities in the SCD group were significantly lower
      than DS group (p < 0.05). The trends in the expression of antioxidant- and
      immune-related genes were generally consistent with the activities of antioxidant
      enzymes. Our study found that the hybrid population had stronger stress
      resistance than their parent populations at the same ammonia concentration. This 
      study confirms our speculation that hybrid population has a greater advantage in 
      antioxidant immunity, which also provides reference for the follow-up study of
      chronic ammonia toxicity.

TI  - Economic incentives drive the conversion of agriculture to aquaculture in the
      Indian Sundarbans: Livelihood and environmental implications of different
      aquaculture types.
PG  - 1963-1977
LID - 10.1007/s13280-022-01720-4 [doi]
AB  - Expansion of aquaculture in the Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve (SBR) is
      irreversibly replacing agricultural land and the drivers of this change are
      disputed. Based on in-depth interviews with 67 aquaculture farmers, this paper
      characterizes major aquaculture types in the SBR, their impacts, and identifies
      drivers of conversion from agricultural land. Aquaculture types included
      traditional, improved-traditional, modified-extensive, and semi-intensive
      systems. Extensive capture of wild shrimp larvae is environmentally harmful but
      constitutes an important livelihood. Semi-intensive aquaculture of exotic shrimp 
      (Litopenaeus vannamei) has much higher unit-area profitability than other types
      but involves greater financial risk. Profitability is the main driver for the
      transition from agriculture, but environmental factors such as lowered crop
      yields and cyclone impacts also contributed. Many conversions from agriculture to
      aquaculture are illegal according to the stakeholders. Existing legislation, if
      enforced, could halt the loss of agriculture, while the promotion of
      improved-traditional aquaculture could reduce the demand for wild seed.

AB  - In this study, we developed and validated a liquid chromatography triple
      quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method used to simultaneously
      determine levels of four fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin, norfloxacin, lomefloxacin, 
      and pefloxacin) and two antipsychotics (diazepam and methaqualone) in fish and
      shrimp. The samples were extracted with a mixture of anhydrous sodium sulfate and
      acetonitrile, and purified by C18 cartridge solid-phase extraction with an
      optimized eluent. The MS(2) method was applied to recognize the molecular
      structure of these compounds according to a main fragmentation scheme. The key
      ions of identification and quantification were deduced from chemical structures. 
      Multiple reaction monitoring was used to quantitatively analyse the compounds of 
      interest. Satisfactory linearities were obtained (R(2) >/=0.99) with the limits
      of quantitation (LOQs) ranging between 0.03 and 1.96 mug kg(-1). The recoveries
      were 74-122%, with a relative standard deviation (RSD) below 4.9% for these
      compounds at the spiking level of three, five, and ten times the LODs,
      respectively. The LC-MS/MS method allows precise and sensitive determination of
      residues of six important banned veterinary drugs in fish and shrimp tissue. This
      methodological approach solved the problem imposed by the need for two or more
      analysis methods to analyse the compounds of interest described in this study.

AB  - The is aim of this study was to evaluate if vitamin E supplementation to diet
      could improve the spermatic quantity and quality in males of Litopenaeus
      vannamei. A basal diet with 171.5 mg/kg (included in commercial vitamin premix)
      and experimental diets with 3 concentrations of vitamin E: 620 (diet A), 1069
      (diet B) and 1517 (diet C) mg/kg were tested by 30 days. 500 L tanks were set up 
      for each treatment, and seven males were set in each tank. Circulant cholesterol,
      triglyceride (TG), glucose, total protein was measured. Sperm quantity and
      quality were classified as normal, abnormal, or dead. In reproductive tract was
      measured the activity and differential expression lipid soluble antioxidant
      system (LSAS) and of immune genes system. The higher sperm quantity was obtained 
      in A diet and decreased in shrimp fed B and C diets (p < 0.05). Males fed diets B
      and C presented a higher activity and relative expression of lipid system oy
      suggesting oxidative stress. A significant increment of prophenol oxidase (proFo)
      and alpha-2-macroglobulin (alpha-2 M) transcripts were observed in males fed C
      diet (p < 0.05). All these variables were present in males with low sperm amount 
      and low hemocyanin gene expression (p < 0.05). Therefore, diet A supplemented
      with 620 mg/kg vitamin E could benefit males L. vannamei broodstock, taking a
      count the sperm quantity and all the lipid and immune genes response.

TI  - TAK1 confers antibacterial protection through mediating the activation of MAPK
      and NF-kappaB pathways in shrimp.

AB  - MAPK and NF-kappaB pathways are important components of innate immune system in
      multicellular animals. In some model organisms, the MAP3-kinase
      TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) have been shown to regulate both MAPK and
      NF-kappaB pathways activation to tailor immune responses to pathogens or
      infections. However, this process is not fully understood in shrimp. In this
      study, we investigated the effect of TAK1 on MAPK and NF-kappaB activation in
      shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei following Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection. We found
      that shrimp TAK1 could activate c-Jun and Relish, the transcription factors of
      MAPK pathway and NF-kappaB pathway, respectively. Specifically, over-expression
      of shrimp TAK1 was able to strongly induce the activities of both AP-1 and
      NF-kappaB reporters. TAK1 was shown to bind several MAP2-kinases, including MKK4,
      MKK6 and MKK7, and induced their phosphorylations, the hallmarks for MAPK
      pathways activation. TAK1 knockdown in vivo also inhibited the nuclear
      translocation of c-Jun and Relish during V. parahaemolyticus infection.
      Accordingly, ectopic expression of shrimp TAK1 in Drosophila S2 cells increased
      the cleavage of co-expressed shrimp Relish, and induced the promoter activity of 
      Relish targeted gene Diptericin (Dpt). Furthermore, knockdown of c-Jun and Relish
      enhanced the sensitivity of shrimp to V. parahaemolyticus infection. These
      findings indicated that shrimp TAK1 conferred antibacterial protection through
      regulating the activation of both MAPK pathway and NF-kappaB pathway, and
      suggested that the TAK1-MAPK/NF-kappaB axis could be a potential therapeutic
      target for enhancing antibacterial responses in crustaceans.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) is one of the typical metal pollutants in the Bohai Sea. To evaluate
      the acute toxicological effects of Cd on marine crustaceans, juvenile
      Fenneropenaeus chinensis and Portunus trituberculatus were exposed to Cd at
      environmentally relevant concentrations (5 and 50 mug/L) for 96 h. Cd
      accumulation, antioxidants and metabolite profiles were characterized to
      elucidate the responses of juvenile crustaceans to Cd stress. Significant Cd
      accumulation was observed in both juvenile crustaceans in 50 mug/L Cd-treated
      group. Results showed that Cd exposure induced hormesis based on the alterations 
      of GSH, SOD and CAT activities (i.e. increased levels in the low concentration of
      Cd treatment and recovered levels in the high concentration of Cd treatment) in
      juvenile P. trituberculatus. Similarly, the responses of GSH contents presented
      hormesis pattern in Cd-treated juvenile F. chinensis. Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase contents 
      were significantly elevated in 50 mug/L Cd-treated group. In addition, untargeted
      NMR-based metabolomics indicated Cd caused the disturbance in osmotic regulation 
      and energy consumption in both juvenile F. chinensis and P. trituberculatus via
      different pathways. The immunotoxicity and movement disorder were uniquely
      demonstrated in juvenile P. trituberculatus after Cd exposure.

AB  - Anthropogenic CO2 emissions have led to the warming and acidification of the
      oceans. Although, there is a growing of evidence showing that simultaneous
      occurrence of ocean acidification and ocean warming are threats to marine
      organisms, information on their combined effect on coastal shrimp species remains
      scarce. The purpose of this study was to estimate the combined effects of
      seawater acidification and warming on growth-related traits and biochemical
      responses of P. elegans juveniles. In this work, shrimp were exposed for 65 days 
      at 4 experimental conditions: pH 8.10 * 18 degrees C, pH 7.80 * 18 degrees C, pH 
      8.10 * 22 degrees C, pH 7.80 * 22 degrees C. The results showed that low pH
      decreases the lipid content by approximately 13% (p < 0.05). Higher temperature
      reduced the condition factor by approximately 11%, the protein content by
      approximately 20%, the PUFA by approximately 8,6% and shortened moulting events
      by 5 days (p > 0.05) while the SFA increased approximately 9.4%. The decrease in 
      condition factor and protein was however more prominent in organisms exposed to
      the combination of pH and temperature with a decrease of approximately 13% and
      approximately 21%, respectively. Furthermore, essential fatty acids as EPA and
      DHA also decreased by approximately 20% and approximately 6.6% in low pH and
      higher temperature condition. Despite this study suggest that warming may have a 
      greater impact than acidification, it has been shown that their combined effect
      can exacerbate these impacts with consequences for the shrimp's body size and
      biochemical profile.

AB  - Halomonas species, which are aerobic, alkaliphilic, and moderately halophilic
      bacteria, produce diverse biochemicals. To identify food-related Halomonas
      strains for bioremediation and the industrial production of biochemicals, 20
      strains were isolated from edible seashells, shrimp, and umeboshi (pickled
      Japanese plum) factory effluents. All isolates were phylogenetically classified
      into a large clade of Halomonas species. Most isolates, which grew in wide pH
      (6-13) and salt concentration (0-14%) ranges, exhibited the intracellular
      accumulation of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) granules. The characteristics of these
      isolates varied. A020 isolated from umeboshi factory effluents exhibited enhanced
      stress tolerance and proliferation and comprised two plasmids. IMZ03 and A020
      grew to more than 200 OD600, while IMZ03 produced 3.5% 3-hydroxybutyrate in
      inorganic medium supplemented with 10% sucrose. The mucus of TK1-1 cultured on
      agar medium comprised approximately 64 mM of ectoine. Whole-genome sequencing of 
      A020 was performed to elucidate its origin and genomic characteristics. The
      genome ana-lysis revealed a region exhibiting synteny with a large virus genome
      isolated from the ocean, but did not identify any predictable pathogenic genes.
      Therefore, saline foods and related materials may be suitable resources for
      isolating Halomonas strains exhibiting unique, useful, and innocuous features.

      improve efficacy of heat-killed Streptococcus agalactiae immersion vaccine.

AB  - Nanobubble technology has shown appealing technical benefits and potential
      applications in aquaculture. We recently found that treatment with ozone
      nanobubbles (NB-O3) activated expression of several immune-related genes leading 
      to effective response to subsequent exposure to fish pathogens. In this study, we
      investigated whether pre-treatment of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) with
      NB-O3 can enhance specific immune responses and improve efficacy of immersion
      vaccination against Streptococcus agalactiae. Spleen and head kidney of fish in
      the vaccinated groups showed a substantial upregulation in expression levels of
      pro-inflammatory cytokine genes (IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6) and immunoglobulin
      classes (IgM, IgD, IgT) compared with the unvaccinated control groups. The mRNA
      transcript of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes was greatest (approx. 2.8-3.3
      folds) on day 7 post-vaccination, whereas the relative expression of
      immunoglobulin genes was greatest (approx. 3.2-4.1 folds) on day 21
      post-immunization. Both systemic and mucosal IgM antibodies were elicited in
      vaccinated groups. As the result, the cumulative survival rate of the vaccinated 
      groups was found to be higher than that of the unvaccinated groups, with a
      relative percent survival (RPS) ranging from 52.9 to 70.5%. However, fish in the 
      vaccinated groups that received pre-treatment with NB-O3, bacterial antigen
      uptakes, expression levels of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6,IgM, IgD, and IgT, as
      well as the specific-IgM antibody levels and percent survival, were all slightly 
      or significantly higher than that of the vaccinated group without pre-treatment
      with NB-O3. Taken together, our findings suggest that utilizing pre-treatment
      with NB-O3 may improve the immune response and efficacy of immersion vaccination 
      in Nile tilapia.

AB  - The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) play
      important roles in innate immunity. Previously, we identified an NLR-like gene,
      LvNLRPL1, and found that it participated in Vibrio infection and regulated
      hemocytes apoptosis in the Pacific whiteleg shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. However,
      it is still unclear whether other NLR-like genes exist in shrimp and how they
      function during virus infection. In the present study, a novel NLR-like gene
      (LvNLRPL2) was identified and functionally characterized in L. vannamei. LvNLRPL2
      was highly expressed in hemocytes and responsive to both Vibrio parahaemolyticus 
      and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection. Knockdown of LvNLRPL2 could
      markedly increase the proliferation of Vibrio and the mortality of shrimp
      infected with V. parahaemolyticus, whereas inhibit in vivo WSSV propagation in
      shrimp, indicating its distinct roles during Vibrio and WSSV infection. After
      LvNLRPL2 knockdown, the apoptotic rate of hemocytes increased, and the expression
      levels of LvCaspase 2, 3 and 5 were significantly up-regulated. In addition,
      LvNLRPL2 could form a hetero-dimer with LvNLRPL1 through their NACHT domains.
      These results suggest that LvNLRPL2 might resist bacterial infection while
      promote WSSV propagation by forming hetero-dimer with LvNLRPL1 and then
      inhibiting apoptosis of hemocytes. These data will be helpful for understanding
      the functions of NLR-like genes and their regulation mechanisms in crustaceans.

AB  - Many invertebrate species inhabit coastal areas where loads of plastic debris and
      microplastics are high. In the current case study, we exemplarily illustrate the 
      principal processes taking place in the Atlantic ditch shrimp, Palaemon varians, 
      upon ingestion of microplastics. In the laboratory, shrimp readily ingested
      fluorescent polystyrene microbeads of 0.1-9.9 microm, which could be tracked
      within the widely translucent body. Ingested food items as well as
      micro-particles cumulate in the stomach where they are macerated and mixed with
      digestive enzymes. Inside the stomach, ingested particles are segregated by size 
      by a complex fine-meshed filter system. Liquids and some of the smallest
      particles (0.1 microm) pass the filter and enter the midgut gland where
      resorption of nutrients as well as synthesis and release of digestive enzymes
      take place. Large particles and most of the small particles are egested with the 
      feces through the hindgut. Small particles, which enter the midgut gland, may
      interact with the epithelial cells and induce oxidative stress, as indicated by
      elevated activities of superoxide dismutase and cellular markers of reactive
      oxygen species. The shrimp indiscriminately ingest microparticles but possess
      efficient mechanisms to protect their organs from overloading with microplastics 
      and other indigestible particles. These include an efficient sorting mechanism
      within the stomach and the protection of the midgut gland by the pyloric filter. 
      Formation of detrimental radical oxygen species is counteracted by the induction 
      of enzymatic antioxidants.

      Growth Performance, Immune Response, and Resistance of Whiteleg Shrimp
      Litopenaeus vannamei Against Vibrio parahaemolyticus.
PG  - 826151

AB  - In this study, we evaluated the effect of probiotic bacteria Pediococcus
      pentosaceus supplemented at different inclusion levels in a control diet [basal
      diet containing 0.5% fructooligosaccharide (FOS)] on the growth performance, feed
      conversion ratio, immune response, and the disease resistance of whiteleg shrimp 
      Litopenaeus vannamei juveniles against Vibrio parahaemolyticus. A control diet
      with 0.5% FOS but without P. pentosaceus supplementation (Control) was prepared. 
      In addition, three other test diets were also formulated: control diet
      supplemented with P. pentosaceus at (i) 1 x 10(6) cfu g(-1) diet (P1), (ii) 1 x
      10(7) cfu g(-1) diet (P2), or (iii) 1 x 10(8) cfu g(-1) diet (P3). After a 60-day
      feeding trial, the experimental shrimps were challenged with V. parahaemolyticus.
      The results showed that dietary supplementation of P. pentosaceus significantly
      improved the growth performance and immune responses of L. vannamei juveniles.
      The juveniles that were fed with a P2 or P3 diet recorded the maximum increase in
      the final body weight, final length, weight gain, and survival rate. The total
      hemocyte counts, phenoloxidase, and lysozyme activity of shrimp fed with either
      of these two diets were significantly enhanced. The results also showed that
      juveniles fed with a P2 or P3 diet exhibited significantly lower mortality when
      challenged with V. parahaemolyticus. Overall results suggested that a combination
      of P. pentosaceus at the inclusion level of 1 x 10(7) cfu g(-1) diet (P2) and
      0.5% FOS could be considered as a potential synbiotic formulation for improving
      the growth, health, and robustness of L. vannamei.

TI  - Efficiency vs resilience: The rise and fall of the German brown shrimp fishery in
      times of COVID 19.
PG  - 104675
LID - 10.1016/j.marpol.2021.104675 [doi]
AB  - In times of world crisis such as climate change and the COVID pandemic much has
      been said about the need for resilience. However, in scenarios of less concern
      about crisis the leading paradigm is often that of efficiency. The current study 
      shows how efficiency might have got on the way of achieving the necessary
      resilience to face the COVID 19. With the example of the German brown shrimp
      fishery in the North Sea the interaction between those two paradigms - efficiency
      and resilience - is shown in the context of the COVID 19 pandemic. For instance, 
      the quest of efficiency for rationalisation may reduce the resources available to
      set aside buffers to resist shocks, and the standardisation key to efficiency may
      also hinder more diversity and hence open innovation for solutions to the crisis,
      all characteristics of resilient organisations. By making use of a literature
      review including peer reviewed, grey literature and web media as well as of
      interviews with experts and quantitative data the value chain of the German brown
      shrimp fishery is analysed under the conceptual framework of organisational
      resilience. Results: show that, despite being more oriented towards efficiency,
      the German fleets does not show particularly good results in selected efficiency 
      indicators. Additionally, key stages of the value chain as processing and
      commercialisation together with the investment strategy fail to present some
      commonly accepted components of resilient organisations, such as redundancy,
      flexibility, adaptability, diversity, prudence and embeddedness. Despite
      developments in the direction of sustainability with the MSC certification, the
      German fleet should pay attention to its capacity to face disturbances, which
      should be supported by a more long-term, targeted, resilience-oriented policy
      support.

TI  - A Novel TRIM9 Protein Promotes NF-kappaB Activation Through Interacting With
      LvIMD in Shrimp During WSSV Infection.
PG  - 819881
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.819881 [doi]
AB  - The TRIpartite Motif (TRIM) proteins play key roles in cell differentiation,
      apoptosis, development, autophagy, and innate immunity in vertebrates. In the
      present study, a novel TRIM9 homolog (designated as LvTRIM9-1) specifically
      expressed in the lymphoid organ of shrimp was identified from the Pacific
      whiteleg shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. Its deduced amino acid sequence possesses
      the typical features of TRIM proteins, including a RING domain, two B-boxes, a
      coiled-coil domain, a FN3 domain, and a SPRY domain. The transcripts of LvTRIM9-1
      were mainly located in the lymphoid tubules of the lymphoid organ. Knockdown of
      LvTRIM9-1 could apparently inhibit the transcriptions of some genes from white
      spot syndrome virus (WSSV) and reduce the viral propagation in the lymphoid
      organ. Overexpression of LvTRIM9-1 in mammalian cells could activate the promoter
      activity of NF-kappaB, and an in vivo experiment in shrimp showed that knockdown 
      of LvTRIM9-1 reduced the expression of LvRelish in the lymphoid organ. Yeast
      two-hybridization and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays confirmed that
      LvTRIM9-1 could directly interact with LvIMD, a key component of the IMD pathway,
      through its SPRY domain. These data suggest that LvTRIM9-1 could activate the IMD
      pathway in shrimp via interaction with LvIMD. This is the first evidence to show 
      the regulation of a TRIM9 protein on the IMD pathway through its direct
      interaction with IMD, which will enrich our knowledge on the role of TRIM
      proteins in innate immunity of invertebrates.

LID - 10.1016/j.sjbs.2022.01.040 [doi]
AB  - Despite advancement in modern medicines, plant derived medicines have still wide 
      range utilities as they have less side effects and are cheap and biocompitable.
      Sassurea lappa is an extensively used plant in traditional medicinal
      formulations. Plant roots are used to cure various diseases including cancer,
      rheumatic pain, abdominal and nervous disorders. The present study was aimed for 
      the evalution of biological potentials of methanolic and chloroform extracts of
      Saussurea lappa root, leaf, seed and flower. The methanolic and chloroform
      extracts were subjected to qualitative and quantitative phytochemical analyses.
      Identification of functional groups was performed using Fourier Transform
      infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Antioxidant potential was determined via
      diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), total reducing power (TRP) and total
      antioxidant capacity (TAC) method, anti-hemolytic potential was conducted on
      human RBCs, antibacterial activity was evaluated against six American type
      culture collection (ATCC) and three multi drug resistance (MDR) strains,
      cytotoxic and phytotoxic potentials were evaluated through brine shrimp lethality
      assay and raddish seed assay respectively. Experiments were performed in
      triplicates and analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied using statistics
      version-8.1. Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of sixteen secondary
      metabolites. Fourteen functional groups were identified through FTIR. S. lappa
      root methanolic (SLRM) showed maximum antioxidant activity index (AAI-79.42%)
      whereas chloroform extract of leaves (SLLC) gave highest antibacterial activity
      with maximum zone of inhibition (ZOI) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.4 mm).
      Maximum cytotoxicity was observed for SLRM with lethal dose concentration (LC50) 
      of 58.8 microg/mL. However, root extracts showed significant phytotoxicity (15%
      germination). The current study investigated that bioactive compounds present in 
      S. lappa leaves, seed, flower and roots were responsible for enhanced biological 
      potentials. Further studies on isolation and characterization of these bioactive 
      compounds may help in drug development. In future, we recommend different
      in-vitro and in-vivo studies to further confirm it biopharmacological potencies.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of
      bacteria isolated from retail fish and shrimp in Tanzania. A total of 92 fish and
      20 shrimp samples were analyzed. Fish samples consisted of 24 Nile tilapia, 24
      Nile perch, and 24 red snapper. The isolates were identified by their
      morphological characteristics, conventional biochemical tests, and analytical
      profile index test kits. The antibiotic susceptibility of selected bacteria was
      determined by the disc diffusion method. Out of the 92 samples analyzed, 96.7%
      were contaminated with 7 different bacterial species. E. coli was the most
      prevalent bacteria (39%), followed by Klebsiella spp. (28%) and Salmonella spp.
      (16%). Other species isolated from this study were Staphylococcus spp. (8%),
      Citrobacter (4%), Shigella spp. (3%), and Pseudomonas spp. (1%). All samples were
      analyzed for Campylobacter spp.; however, none of the samples tested were
      positive for Campylobacter spp. Fish from the open-air market were contaminated
      by six bacterial species: E. coli (40%), Klebsiella spp. (26%), Salmonella spp.
      (24%), Shigella spp. (6.7%), Citrobacter spp. (6.5%), and Pseudomonas spp. (2%), 
      while E. coli (37%), Klebsiella spp. (33%), Staphylococcus spp. (23%), and
      Shigella spp. (2%) were isolated in supermarket samples. According to the
      International Commission on Microbiological Specifications for Foods criteria, 54
      (58.7%) and 38 (41.3%) samples were good and marginally acceptable, respectively.
      E. coli isolates were resistant to penicillin (PEN), erythromycin (ERY),
      gentamicin (GEN), azithromycin (AZM), and tetracycline (TET), while Salmonella
      spp. isolates exhibited resistance to gentamicin (CN), tetracycline (TET),
      penicillin (PEN), and erythromycin (ERY). These results suggest that the presence
      of these bacteria might cause a health risk/hazard to human beings and may cause 
      disease to susceptible individuals, especially immune-compromised consumers.

TI  - Investigation of the activity of cathepsin B in red shrimp (Solenocera

      and frozen storage.
PG  - 1610-1623

AB  - Cathepsin B is a cysteine protease that has important effects on the quality of
      muscle products. In this study, the changes of cathepsin B activity and its
      relation to muscle proteins were investigated in intact and beheaded shrimp
      during chilled and frozen storage. The obtained results indicated that the water 
      holding capacity (WHC), shear force, hardness, and myofibrillar protein (MP)
      content all significantly decreased in both the intact and beheaded shrimp
      samples with increasing storage period (p < 0.05). Specifically, beheading shrimp
      exhibited much more stable characteristics than intact shrimp samples during both
      chilled and frozen storage. The enzyme activity results suggested that cold
      temperature and storage induced the release of cathepsin B from the lysosomes to 
      the mitochondria, sarcoplasm, and myofibrils in the muscle tissues. Furthermore, 
      SDS-PAGE and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed that
      beheading the shrimp greatly inhibited the dissociation of shrimp muscle proteins
      during storage. The current findings suggest that cathepsin B located in the head
      of shrimp was likely transferred to the muscle through the first abdominal
      segment during storage, accelerating the dissociation of the muscle proteins.
      Therefore, beheading the shrimp was conducive to prolonging the shelf-life of
      stored shrimp products.

      hepatopancreas challenged by Vibrio alginolyticus reveals lipid metabolic
      disturbance.

AB  - Vibrio alginolyticus is a devastating bacterial pathogen of Pacific white shrimp 
      (Litopenaeus vannamei), which often causes acute hepatopancreatic necrosis
      syndrome (AHPNS) and early mortality syndrome (EMS). Elucidation of molecular
      mechanisms of L. vannamei in responding to infection is essential for controlling
      the epidemic. In the present study, transcriptomic profiles of L. vannamei
      hepatopancreas were explored by injecting with PBS or V. alginolyticus.
      Hepatopancreas morphology of L. vannamei was also assessed. The result reveals
      that compared with the hepatopancreas of PBS group, the storage cells (R-cell),
      secretory cells (B-cell) and star-shaped polygonal structures of the lumen were
      disappeared and necrotic after challenged by V. alginolyticus at 24 h.
      Transcriptome data showed that a total of 314 differential expression genes were 
      induced by V. alginolyticus, with 133 and 181 genes up- and down-regulated,
      respectively. These genes were mainly associated with lysosome pathway,
      glycerophospholipid metabolism, drug metabolism-other enzymes, cysteine and
      methionine metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and PPAR signal pathway. Among
      these pathways, the lysosome pathway, glycerophospholipid metabolism and PPAR
      signal pathway were both related with lipid metabolism. Therefore, we detected
      the lipid accumulation in hepatopancreas by Oil Red O staining, TG and CHOL
      detection and the relative mRNA expression of several lipid metabolism related
      genes in the hepatopancreas of shrimp after challenge to V. alginolyticus. The
      present data reveals that lipids from the L. vannamei are nutrient sources for
      the V. alginolyticus and define the fate of the infection by modulating lipid
      homeostasis. These findings may have important implication for understanding the 
      L. vannamei and V. alginolyticus interactions, and provide a substantial dataset 
      for further research and may deliver the basis for preventing the bacterial
      diseases.

AB  - Penaeus vannamei is an important cultured shrimp that has high commercial value
      in the worldwide. However, the industry suffers heavy economic losses each year
      due to disease outbreaks caused by pathogenic bacteria. In the present study,
      after Vibrio alginolyticus infection, DNA damage in the hemocytes of the shrimp
      markedly increased, and autophagy and apoptosis increased significantly.
      Subsequently, hemocytes were sampled from the control and infected shrimp and
      sequenced for mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) 24 h after V. alginolyticus infection to 
      better understand the response mechanism to bacterial infection in P. vannamei.
      We identified 1,874 and 263 differentially expressed mRNAs (DEGs) and miRNAs
      (DEMs) respectively, and predicted that 997 DEGs were targeted by DEMs. These
      DEGs were involved in the regulation of multiple signalling pathways, such as
      Toll and IMD signalling, TGF-beta signalling, MAPK signalling, and cell
      apoptosis, during Vibrio alginolyticus infection of the shrimp. We identified
      numerous mRNA-miRNA interactions, which provide insight into the defense
      mechanism that occur during the antimicrobial process of P. vannamei.

TI  - Expression of the AHPND Toxins PirA(vp) and PirB(vp) Is Regulated by Components
      of the Vibrio parahaemolyticus Quorum Sensing (QS) System.
LID - 2889 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23052889 [doi]
AB  - Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) in shrimp is caused by Vibrio
      strains that harbor a pVA1-like plasmid containing the pirA and pirB genes. It is
      also known that the production of the PirA and PirB proteins, which are the key
      factors that drive the observed symptoms of AHPND, can be influenced by
      environmental conditions and that this leads to changes in the virulence of the
      bacteria. However, to our knowledge, the mechanisms involved in regulating the
      expression of the pirA/pirB genes have not previously been investigated. In this 
      study, we show that in the AHPND-causing Vibrio parahaemolyticus 3HP strain, the 
      pirA(vp) and pirB(vp) genes are highly expressed in the early log phase of the
      growth curve. Subsequently, the expression of the PirA(vp) and PirB(vp) proteins 
      continues throughout the log phase. When we compared mutant strains with a
      deletion or substitution in two of the quorum sensing (QS) master regulators,
      luxO and/or opaR (luxO(D47E), DeltaopaR, DeltaluxO, and DeltaopaRDeltaluxO), our 
      results suggested that expression of the pirA(vp) and pirB(vp) genes was related 
      to the QS system, with luxO acting as a negative regulator of pirA(vp) and
      pirB(vp) without any mediation by opaR(vp). In the promoter region of the
      pirA(vp)/pirB(vp) operon, we also identified a putative consensus binding site
      for the QS transcriptional regulator AphB. Real-time PCR further showed that
      aphB(vp) was negatively controlled by LuxO(vp), and that its expression
      paralleled the expression patterns of pirA(vp) and pirB(vp). An electrophoretic
      mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that AphB(vp) could bind to this predicted
      region, even though another QS transcriptional regulator, AphA(vp), could not.
      Taken together, these findings suggest that the QS system may regulate
      pirA(vp)/pirB(vp) expression through AphB(vp).

TI  - Effects of Shrimp Peptide Hydrolysate on Intestinal Microbiota Restoration and
      Immune Modulation in Cyclophosphamide-Treated Mice.
LID - 1720 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27051720 [doi]
AB  - The gut microbiota is important in regulating host metabolism, maintaining
      physiology, and protecting immune homeostasis. Gut microbiota dysbiosis affects
      the development of the gut microenvironment, as well as the onset of various
      external systemic diseases and metabolic syndromes. Cyclophosphamide (CTX) is a
      commonly used chemotherapeutic drug that suppresses the host immune system,
      intestinal mucosa inflammation, and dysbiosis of the intestinal flora.
      Immunomodulators are necessary to enhance the immune system and prevent
      homeostasis disbalance and cytotoxicity caused by CTX. In this study, shrimp
      peptide hydrolysate (SPH) was evaluated for immunomodulation, intestinal
      integration, and microbiota in CTX-induced immunosuppressed mice. It was observed
      that SPH would significantly restore goblet cells and intestinal mucosa
      integrity, modulate the immune system, and increase relative expression of mRNA
      and tight-junction associated proteins (Occludin, Zo-1, Claudin-1, and Mucin-2). 
      It also improved gut flora and restored the intestinal microbiota ecological
      balance by removing harmful microbes of various taxonomic groups. This would also
      increase the immune organs index, serum levels of cytokines (IFN-Upsilon,
      IL1beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6), and immunoglobin levels (IgA, IgM). The
      Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes proportion was decreased in CTX-induced mice. Finally,
      SPH would be recommended as a functional food source with a modulatory effect not
      only on intestinal microbiota, but also as a potential health-promoting immune
      function regulator.

TI  - NM23 Is a CP-Binding Protein Involved in Infectious Hypodermal and Hematopoietic 
      Necrosis Virus Infection in Shrimp.
LID - 621 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12050621 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to identify the putative host cell receptor for
      Infectious Hypodermal and Hematopoietic Necrosis Virus (IHHNV) CP in the gill
      membrane of L. vannamei. Putative CP binding partners were screened first using a
      2-dimensional Virus Overlay Protein Blot Assay (VOPBA) to probe isolated gill
      membrane proteins using recombinant CP. Putative binding partners were identified
      using mass spectrometry. A Phage Display Random Dodecapeptide Library was used to
      screen for dodecapeptides and motifs that bound to CP. Finally, putative binding 
      pairs were confirmed using GST(glutathione-S-transferase) pulldown assays.
      2-Dimensional VOPBA identified NM23 as a putative binding partner for IHHNV CP.
      GST pulldown experiments confirmed the direct interaction of NM23 and IHHNV CP.
      The phage display library was used to identify six groups of dodecapeptides that 
      bound to CP. From these peptides, three characteristic binding motifs were
      identified, SW*Y, SKWV, and PQR. Interestingly, the SW*Y motif was also found in 
      NM23. We are the first to implicate NM23 in IHHNV infection and postulate that it
      may bind to the CP using the SW*Y motif, although this remains to be confirmed.

TI  - Haemolymphatic Parameters in Two Aquaculture Crustacean Species Cherax destructor
      (Clark, 1836) and Cherax quadricarinatus (Von Martens, 1868).
LID - 543 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12050543 [doi]
AB  - In the last few years, there has been a notable development in the breeding of
      freshwater shrimp (astaciculture), which involved various species and in
      particular, the two Australian Parastacidae species, Cherax destructor and Cherax
      quadricarinatus. Information about the haemolymphatic parameters of these two
      species is fragmentary, and filling these gaps becomes important given their
      importance in aquaculture. Cellular and biochemical parameters were analyzed in
      both species to create a reference baseline for these parameters to identify the 
      state of welfare or suffering of these animals. The results showed that the total
      haemocyte count, haemocyte subpopulations, enzymatic activities and pH are
      similar between the two species, while total protein and osmolality are higher in
      C. destructor than C. quadricarinatus. Knowledge of these parameters could assist
      in evaluating the good health status of these species kept in aquaculture
      facilities.

TI  - Inhibition of Several Bacterial Species Isolated from Squid and Shrimp Skewers by
      Different Natural Edible Compounds.
LID - 757 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/foods11050757 [doi]
AB  - Seafood is an excellent source of nutrients, essential for a healthy diet,
      ranging from proteins and fatty acids to vitamins and minerals. Seafood products 
      are highly perishable foods due to their nutritional characteristics and
      composition. The application of nontoxic, natural, and edible preservatives to
      extend the shelf-life and inhibit bacterial proliferation of several foods has
      been a hot topic. Consequently, this work aimed to perform the microbiological
      characterization of squid and shrimp skewers during their shelf-life (five days) 
      and evaluate the susceptibility of randomly isolated microorganisms to several
      natural edible compounds so that their application for the preservation and
      shelf-life extension of the product might be analyzed in the future. The product 
      had considerably high total microorganisms loads of about 5 log CFU/g at day zero
      and 9 log CFU/g at day five. In addition, high bacterial counts of Pseudomonas
      spp., Enterobacterales, and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were found, especially on 
      the last day of storage, being Pseudomonas the dominant genus. However, no
      Escherichia coli or Listeria monocytogenes were detected on the analyzed samples.
      One hundred bacterial isolates were randomly selected and identified through 16s 
      rRNA sequencing, resulting in the detection of several Enterobacterales,
      Pseudomonas spp., and LAB. The antibacterial activity of carvacrol, olive leaf
      extract, limonene, Citrox((R)), different chitosans, and ethanolic propolis
      extracts was evaluated by the agar diffusion method, and the minimum inhibitory
      concentration was determined only for Citrox((R)) since only this solution could 
      inhibit all the identified isolates. At concentrations higher than or equal to
      1.69% (v/v), Citrox((R)) demonstrated bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity to
      97% and 3% of the isolates, respectively. To our knowledge, there are no
      available data about the effectiveness of this commercial product on seafood
      isolates. Although preliminary, this study showed evidence that Citrox((R)) has
      the potential to be used as a natural preservative in these seafood products,
      improving food safety and quality while reducing waste. However, further studies 
      are required, such as developing a Citrox((R))-based coating and its application

AB  - The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) intracellular signaling pathway
      mediates numerous biological processes, including antimicrobial immune response
      by inducing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) production. Although MAPK signaling
      cascade proteins have been identified in penaeid shrimp, their modulation via the
      MKK4-p38-c-Jun cascade and effect on AMPs production is unknown. Here, we show
      that hemocyanin (PvHMC), antimicrobial peptides (anti-lipopolysaccharide factor, 
      crustin, and penaeidins), and MKK4-p38-c-Jun cascade proteins are simultaneously 
      induced by pathogens (Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, and white
      spot syndrome virus) in Penaeus vannamei. Intriguingly, knockdown of PvHMC with
      or without pathogen challenge attenuated the expression of MKK4-p38-c-Jun cascade
      proteins and their phosphorylation level, which consequently decreased AMPs
      expression. Further analysis revealed that PvHMC interacts via its armadillo
      (ARM) repeat domain with PvMKK4 to modulate the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Thus,
      the ARM repeat domain enables penaeid shrimp hemocyanin to modulate AMPs
      expression during antimicrobial response by activating the p38 MAPK signaling
      pathway.

TI  - The onset of deep recycling of supracrustal materials at the Paleo-Mesoarchean
      boundary.
PG  - nwab136
LID - 10.1093/nsr/nwab136 [doi]
AB  - The recycling of supracrustal materials, and in particular hydrated rocks, has a 
      profound impact on mantle composition and thus on the formation of continental
      crust, because water modifies the physical properties of lithological systems and
      the mechanisms of partial melting and fractional fractionation. On the modern
      Earth, plate tectonics offers an efficient mechanism for mass transport from the 
      Earth's surface to its interior, but how far this mechanism dates back in the
      Earth's history is still uncertain. Here, we use zircon oxygen (O) isotopes to
      track recycling of supracrustal materials into the magma sources of early Archean
      igneous suites from the Kaapvaal Craton, southern Africa. The mean delta (18)O
      values of zircon from TTG (tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite) rocks abruptly
      increase at the Paleo-Mesoarchean boundary (ca. 3230 million years ago; Ma), from
      mantle zircon values of 5 per thousand-6 per thousand to approaching 7.1 per
      thousand, and this increase occurs in </=3230 Ma rocks with elevated Dy/Yb
      ratios. The (18)O enrichment is a unique signature of low-temperature water-rock 
      interaction on the Earth's surface. Because the later phase was emplaced into the
      same crustal level as the older one and TTG magmas would derive from melting
      processes in the garnet stability field (>40 km depth), we suggest that this
      evident shift in TTG zircon O isotopic compositions records the onset of
      recycling of the mafic oceanic crust that underwent seawater hydrothermal
      alteration at low temperature. The onset of the enhanced recycling of
      supracrustal materials may also have developed elsewhere in other Archean cratons
      and reflects a significant change in the tectonic realm during craton formation
      and stabilization, which may be important processes for the operation of plate
      tectonics on early Earth.

AB  - Medicinal plants have been the good source of treatment for different ailments of
      humans as well as animals for centuries. However, in Tanzania, few plants were
      investigated for their efficacy against various diseases of chickens. In the
      present study, four medicinal plants were investigated against Salmonella
      gallinarum isolated from chickens. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)
      using the broth microdilution methods and minimum bactericidal concentration
      (MBCs) were used to evaluate the activities of plants against chicken
      salmonellosis. For the safety of chickens against the toxicity of plants, the
      cytotoxicity assay was determined using a brine shrimp lethality test. Aloe
      secundiflora leaf ethyl acetate (ALEA), Aloe rabaiensis leaf methanolic (ArM),
      Aloe rabaiensis leaf ethyl acetate (ArLEA), and Punica granatum leaf ethyl
      acetate (PGLEA) extracts exhibited the highest MIC (0.3906 mg/mL) and MBC (3.125 
      mg/mL), respectively. The Dolichos kilimandscharicus tuber ethyl acetate (DTEA)
      and Dolichos kilimandscharicus tuber pet ether (DTPE) extracts displayed MIC of
      1.563 mg/mL and 12.50 mg/mL and MBC of 12.50 mg/mL and 25.50 mg/mL, respectively.
      The highest LC50 values exhibited in Dolichos kilimandscharicus ranged from 7.937
      x 10(-4) mg/mL to 7.242 x 10(-2) mg/mL for pet ether and methanolic extracts,
      respectively, while ALEA extract exhibited LC50 of 7.645 x 10(-3) mg/mL.
      Generally, the extracts with MIC 0.3906 mg/mL and MBC 3.125 mg/mL demonstrated
      the highest antibacterial activity with low toxicity efficient to manage chicken 
      salmonellosis. Dolichos kilimandscharicus, which exhibited higher toxicity,
      warrants further investigation on insecticidal and anticancer agents.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Shrimp is a worldwide food commodity, it is a source of several
      nutrients and vitamins; however, this food is one of the major sources of arsenic
      for humans. Legislation around the world set limits for the concentration of this
      element in crustaceans but is mainly concerned with total analysis. Although,
      arsenic species have different toxicities and total analysis could be ineffective
      for making decisions about food security. METHODS: Samples of wild
      (Farfantepenaeus brasiliensis) and farmed shrimps (Litopenaeus vannamei) from NE 
      Brazil were fractionated in subsamples of carapace, muscle tissue and viscera.
      The whole shrimp as well as the animal tissue fractions were decomposed using
      microwave digestion and total arsenic was analyzed by mass spectrometry
      inductively coupled plasm (ICP-MS). The water-soluble arsenic species were
      extracted, and the extract was carried for speciation analysis using HPLC-ICP-MS 
      with an anionic and cationic column. RESULTS: Total As in wild shrimp samples
      exceeded Brazilian and USA food legislation by one order of magnitude, with
      concentrations of 11.5 +/- 0.5 mg kg(-1), while farmed shrimp had significantly
      lower total arsenic levels (0.53 +/- 0.09 mg kg(-1)). More than 60% of the As was
      in the edible fraction in the wild shrimp, while in farmed shrimp this was less
      than 50%. The speciation analysis showed that arsenobetaine (AsB) was the
      predominant As form and iAs was below the Chinese legislation levels (iAs <0.50
      mg kg(-1)) for shrimp in both species. CONCLUSION: The arsenic uptake in wild and
      farmed shrimp was discussed and some differences were found related to feed and
      salinity. About legislation, it has been concluded that most food legislations
      that consider only tAs are not appropriate to assess the toxicity of As in
      seafood. It is necessary to update the legislation of food control agencies to
      insert As speciation analysis in their protocols.

AB  - Maternal stress (MS) has long-term effects on fetal brain development and
      consequently increases the risk of neuropsychiatric diseases in the offspring,
      however, the mechanism that links between early life stress and subsequent
      neuropsychiatric diseases is still not clear. It is well known that both
      neuroinflammation and autophagy dysfunction contributes to the pathology of
      psychiatric disorders. We hypothesized that MS might alter autophagy function and
      activate the neuroimmune response in the pup's brain. To test this hypothesis, we
      investigated the effects of MS on the expression of the autophagy biomarker and
      neuroimmune response in the hippocampus of rat pups. Results revealed that
      MS-induced a long-term decrease of LC3B-II throughout the postnatal periods,
      together with an increase of IL-6 and IL-10 in the hippocampus of rat pups during
      adolescence. These changes lasted at least until adulthood. Results from the In
      vitro studies showed that a partially toxic dose of corticosterone (CORT) induced
      a significant decrease of LC3B-II, together with an increase of IL-6 and IL-10,
      in the SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, suppression of autophagy by mycophenolic acid
      (MPA) leads to an increased IL-6 and IL-10 expression in the CORT-treated SH-SY5Y
      cells. Findings suggested that CORT decreased autophagy dysfunction could
      activate neuroimmune response in the SH-SY5Y cells. Results from this study
      provides initial evidence for the relationship between stress hormone, autophagy 
      dysfunction, and neuroimmune activation, which may be the linking mechanism
      between early-life stress and subsequent neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Hepatopancreatic microsporidiosis caused by Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP) is 
      associated with severe production losses in Penaeus vannamei farming. Early
      responses in P. vannamei experimentally infected with EHP was assessed in this
      study by feeding infected hepatopancreatic tissue and by injecting purified EHP
      spores ( approximately 1 x 10(5) Spores/shrimp). Immune responses to EHP
      infection were assessed in the haemolymph by analysing the total haemocyte count 
      (THC), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, prophenoloxidase activity (proPO),
      respiratory burst activity (RBA), catalase activity (CAT), lysozyme activity
      (LYS) and Toll gene expression in hepatopancreas at 0, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 
      72 h post-infection (hpi). Experimental infection with EHP resulted in a
      significant (p < 0.05) reduction in the immune parameters such THC, CAT and LYS
      at 6, 24 and 24 hpi respectively while there was a significant increase (p <
      0.05) in the levels of SOD, proPO and RBA at 6 hpi. The expression of the Toll
      gene was significantly upregulated (p < 0.05) after experimental infection with
      EHP from 6 hpi. These findings on immune responses in P. vannamei during EHP
      infection will assist in the development of suitable management measures to
      reduce the negative impacts of EHP in P. vannamei farming. This is the first
      report on early responses in P. vannamei during EHP infection.

TI  - Can hypoosmotic shock and calcium influx lead to translocation of aquaporin-1 in 
      shrimp muscle cells?
PG  - 976-985

AB  - The physiological variations during the crustacean molting cycle have intrigued
      researchers for many years. Maintaining osmotic homeostasis in the face of
      hemolymph dilution and dealing with dynamic intracellular and extracellular
      calcium fluctuations are challenges these animals continuously confront. It has
      recently been shown that water channels present in the cell membrane (aquaporins)
      are essential for water uptake during premolt and postmolt. This study aims to
      investigate whether hypoosmotic shock and intracellular and extracellular calcium
      variations can lead to translocation of Aquaporin 1 (AQP-1) from the
      intracellular region to the plasma membrane during premolt and postmolt, thus
      allowing increased water flow in these stages. For this, we investigate in vitro 
      the rapid change of AQP-1 positions in the abdominal muscle cells in the
      freshwater shrimp, Palaemon argentinus. Using cell volume analysis and
      immunohistochemistry, we show that hypoosmotic conditions and an elevation of the
      intracellular and extracellular calcium concentrations are concurrent with the
      translocation of AQP-1 to the plasma membrane. These results indicate that
      calcium flux and hypoosmotic shock may be regulators of AQP 1 in the
      translocation process.

TI  - Metabolomics approach to elucidate the importance of count size in commercial
      penaeid shrimps: white leg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) and black tiger shrimp
      (Penaeusmonodon).

AB  - Currently, count size is applied globally as a grading standard to sell head-less
      shell-on farmed shrimp. Although count size does not indicate directly the
      quality of shrimp, the price of shrimp generally increases proportionally with
      the increase of shrimp size. The importance of the size of white leg shrimp has
      been previously reported, where a strong correlation was found between size and
      metabolome data. In this study, we aimed to improve the predictive power of the
      orthogonal projection to latent structure (OPLS) model by expanding the
      metabolite coverage using liquid chromatography mass-spectrometry (LC/MS) and gas
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis. The training set consisted of 
      11 different-sized white leg shrimps from Indonesia and was validated in a
      step-wise manner by introducing an independent dataset consisting of commercial
      shrimp from the Japanese market. The first validation set consisted of commercial
      white leg shrimp, resulting in standard deviation error estimation and prediction
      values of 1.648 and 2.617, respectively. IMP and AMP, which are metabolites
      responsible for the umami taste in crustaceans, showed the highest variable
      importance in projection (VIP) scores and positively correlated with the increase
      in shrimp size. The second validation was carried out to evaluate the
      applicability of the size-metabolome relationship to other commercial penaeid
      shrimp species. The commercial black tiger shrimps with count sizes of 31/40,
      21/25, 16/20, and 13/15 failed to predict the size of shrimp, suggesting that the
      importance of size in relation to the metabolome profile was rather
      species-specific.

TI  - Defining Biomarkers to Predict Natural Resolution in Shrimp Allergy.
PG  - 210-219
LID - 10.4168/aair.2022.14.2.210 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Tolerance to shrimp has been reported in some patients with a history of
      shrimp allergy. The predictors of the natural resolution of shrimp allergy have
      not been widely explored. This study aimed to investigate the role of specific
      IgE (sIgE) and specific IgG4 (sIgG4) to shrimp extracts and the cross-reactive
      shrimp allergens tropomyosin (TM), arginine kinase (AK) and myosin light-chain
      (MLC), as markers of persistent or resolved shrimp allergy (PSA or RSA). METHODS:
      Seventeen patients with a 10-year history of allergy to Penaeus monodon (Pm)
      and/or Macrobachium rosenbergii (Mr) were recruited. Oral shrimp challenges
      identified 10 patients with PSA and 7 patients with RSA. Sera from these patients
      were evaluated for sIgE and sIgG4 to Mr and Pm extracts as well as to TM, AK and 
      MLC. RESULTS: The levels of sIgE to Mr and Pm extracts were lower in the RSA than
      in the PSA groups (P = 0.05 and P = 0.008, respectively), but sIgG4 or sIgG4:sIgE
      ratio did not show statistical significance. The sIgE to AK and MLC, but not TM, 
      were lower in the RSA group than in the PSA group (P = 0.009 and P = 0.0008,
      respectively). There was no difference in sIgG4 to TM, AK and MLC between both
      groups. The ratio of sIgG4:sIgE to MLC, but not TM or AK, was higher in the RSA
      than in the PSA group (P = 0.02). A higher diversity of sIgE to shrimp components
      was found in the PSA group than in the RSA group (P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS:
      Specific bioassays can be used to identify patients with RSA. Oral shrimp
      challenges in these patients may provide a higher rate of passing the challenges 
      and finally reintroducing shrimp in their diet.

AB  - In the present study, a novel method based on peptidomics and bioinformatic was
      applied to identification and characterization of antifreeze peptides (AFPs) from
      shrimp byproducts autolysate (SBPA). According to the results of in silico
      prediction and high peptide structural inflexibility, DEYEESGPGIVH and
      EQICINFCNEK were picked as potential AFP-1 and AFP-2, respectively. The outcomes 
      of DSC determination indicated that TH of synthesized AFP-1 and AFP-2 (10 mg/mL) 
      were 1.37 degrees C and 1.57 degrees C, respectively. Besides, 0.1 %-3 % AFPs
      showed significant cryoprotection in shrimp muscle after 3 and 6 freeze-thaw
      cycles, evidenced by higher SSP content, Ca(2+)-ATPase activity, sulfhydryl
      content and lower surface hydrophobicity than control; while the higher
      concentration resulted in better protection against freeze induced denaturation. 
      Both AFP-1&2 showed favorable hydrogen bonding affinity which facilitated ice
      binding and ice crystal growth inhibition. This work could provide new ideals for
      identification and characterization of AFPs.

AB  - Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are known to be persistent and toxic, and can
      be accumulated and trophic magnified in the environments. PFASs are widely
      distributed, and their coastal input poses a threat to the health of aquatic
      organisms and local residents. In present study, 17 PFASs including one emerging 
      polyether substitute in water, sediment, and organisms were investigated from the
      South China Sea. Perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) was predominant in water, of which
      concentration ranged from ND to 10.26 ng/L, with a mean of 5.21 ng/L. Similar to 
      sediment and organisms, PFBA was the substance with the highest concentration
      detected among PFASs. This result seemingly indicated that use of short-chain
      PFASs as substitutes for long-chain PFASs in recent years. Trophic magnification 
      factors (TMFs) of PFASs were estimated in the marine food web. TMFs > 1 was
      observed only in perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), indicating a
      biomagnification potential of PFOS in the given ecosystem. The estimated daily
      intake (EDI) of PFOS and PFOA were most prevalent in mollusk, whereas the EDI of 
      PFBA was greater in fish and shrimp. The hazard ratio (HR) reported for seven
      dominant PFASs were lower than 1, which suggests that PFASs via seafood
      consumption would not cause significant health risk to local residents.

      Female Broodstock Pacific White Shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei.
PG  - 830934
LID - 10.3389/fnut.2022.830934 [doi]
AB  - Research on nutrition and feed development for the broodstock of the Pacific
      white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, is rare, and a poor broodstock quality is a
      critical factor restricting the seed supply in shrimp farming. As an essential
      nutrient for the gonadal development of L. vannamei, one control diet (no
      phospholipid) and three typical phospholipids (soybean lecithin, egg yolk
      lecithin, and krill oil) were evaluated in a semipurified diet of 4% phospholipid
      for a 28-day trial (initial weight 34.7 +/- 4.2 g). Dietary phospholipid
      supplementation significantly promoted the ovarian maturation of female L.
      vannamei. Compared with soybean lecithin and egg yolk lecithin, krill oil showed 
      the best positive results. Shrimp fed with a diet krill oil has obtained a
      significantly higher gonadosomatic index, yolk particle deposition, lipid
      accumulation, and estrogen secretion than from other sources. Ovary lipidomic
      analysis showed that the krill oil enriched the lipid composition of the ovary.
      The "glycerophospholipid metabolism" and "sphingolipid metabolism" pathways were 
      significantly varied via topological pathway analysis. Genes and hub genes, with 
      significantly different expression levels, were significantly enriched in the
      "fatty acid metabolism pathway," "glycerophospholipid metabolism," and
      "arachidonic acid metabolism" pathways by transcriptomic analysis. Correlation
      analysis of the transcriptome and lipidomics showed that the differential gene
      "hormone-sensitive lipase-like" (HSL) was positively correlated with various
      lipids [triglycerides (TG), phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylserine (P),
      phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), glucosylceramide (GlcCer), phosphatidylglycerol
      (PG), and phosphatidylinositol (PI)] but was negatively correlated with
      diacylglycerol (DG), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), and sphingomyelin (SM). 
      In conclusion, the dietary phospholipids, especially krill oil as a phospholipid 
      source, can promote the development of L. vannamei ovaries by increasing the
      accumulation of nutrients such as triglycerides and sterols, and the secretion of
      estrogen or related hormones, such as estradiol and methylfarneside, by affecting
      the metabolism of glycerol phospholipids and some key fatty acids.

AB  - The omnipresence of microplastics (MPs) in marine and coastal environments has
      attracted attention owing to their effects on various organisms, including
      humans. We present the first study of MPs in the gastrointestinal tract (GT),
      gills (GI), and exoskeleton (EX) of the farmed whiteleg shrimp Litopenaeus
      vannamei from commercial aquaculture facilities in northwestern Mexico that have 
      operated semi-intensively for the last two decades. We found that the number of
      MP items per tissue was 7.6 +/- 0.6 in the GT, 6.3 +/- 0.9 in the GI, and 4.3 +/-
      0.9 in the EX, with an average of 18.5 +/- 1.2 MP items per shrimp (1.06 items/g,
      wet weight [ww]). MP concentrations were 261.7 +/- 84.5, 13.1 +/- 1.8, and 2.6
      +/- 0.6 items/g (ww) in the GT, GI, and EX, respectively. Microplastics ranged
      from 30 to 2800 mum in size (360 +/- 39 mum) with fibers ( approximately 90.8%), 
      filament-shape ( approximately 93.4%), and transparent ( approximately 47.7%)
      being the most common ones. Polyethylene ( approximately 54.5%) and polyamide (
      approximately 24.2%) were the most commonly identified polymers, although
      polyesters ( approximately 12.1%), polystyrene ( approximately 6.1%), and nylon (
      approximately 3.0%) were also found. The abundance of MPs in farmed L. vannamei
      may be related to their feeding habits and the availability of MP sources in
      aquaculture facilities.

AB  - It is important to develop tools that can be used to understand the effects of
      processing on allergenic foods in order to achieve personalized food labeling. To
      evaluate the effect of heating on the allergy-relevant structural properties of
      tropomyosin (TM), arginine kinase (AK), myosin light chain (MLC) and sarcoplasmic
      calcium-binding protein (SCP) shrimp allergens, trypsin digests of raw, fried and
      baked shrimp extracts were analyzed by peptidomics and epitope correlations.
      Processing altered the number of peptides released from the distinct allergens,
      and each treatment generated a specific epitope-matched peptide allergen
      fingerprint. Among the four allergens, TM led to a number of released peptides
      and epitope changes being detected, and AK provided the epitope-matched
      (331)MGLTEFQAVK(340) sequence as a common differentiating peptide for heat
      processing. These results provide new views on the structural effects of
      processing on major shrimp allergens and peptide candidates as processing
      biomarkers.

AB  - Copper pyrithione (CuPT) is used globally to prevent biofouling. However, it
      poses certain risks to aquatic ecosystems. To understand the effects of CuPT on
      Litopenaeus vannamei after exposure to different concentrations of CuPT (0, 64,
      and 128 mug/L), the apoptotic cell ratio, production of reactive oxygen species
      (ROS), and gene expression in the hemocytes were studied at 0, 3, 12, 24, and 48 
      h. The results revealed that ROS production was induced significantly at 3-48 h
      only in the 128 mug/L groups. The apoptotic cell ratio was increased
      significantly at 12 and 24 h in the 64 mug/L groups, and at 3-48 h in the 128
      mug/L groups. Meanwhile, CuPT exposure changed gene expression in hemocytes at
      different levels. In the 64 mug/L groups, the expression of Mn-superoxide
      dismutase (MnSOD) was induced at 12 h, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) was induced
      at 24 and 48 h, caspase-3 induced at 24 h, metallothionein (MT) and HSP70 were
      increased at 3 h. In the 128 mug/L groups, MnSOD was increased at 3 h and then
      decreased at 12-48 h, GPx was up-regulated at 3, 24 h and then decreased at 48 h,
      caspase-3 was increased at 24 h, MT was increased at 3-48 h, HSP60 and HSP70 were
      up-regulated at 3-12 h. These results indicated that CuPT induced ROS production 
      and the expression of caspase-3 in hemocytes, then caused hemocyte apoptosis.
      Expression levels of MnSOD, GPx, MT, HSP60, and HSP70 were up-regulated to
      protect the hemocyte against CuPT stress.

AB  - Numerous lectins act as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in the innate immune
      system of invertebrates. Here, a galectin (FmGal) was isolated from hemocytes of 
      Fenneropenaeus merguiensis. FmGal contained one open reading frame encoding a
      peptide of 338 amino acids. The primary sequence of FmGal comprised a
      carbohydrate recognition domain with a specific galactose binding site. The FmGal
      transcripts were found mostly in hemocytes of healthy shrimp. The expression of
      FmGal was up-regulated upon challenge with Vibrio parahaemolyticus and white spot
      syndrome virus (WSSV). Gene-silencing with FmGal double-stranded RNA resulted in 
      extreme down-regulation of FmGal. Knockdown with a co-injection of pathogens
      reduced the survival rate of shrimp. The recombinantr protein of FmGal (rFmGal)
      required Ca(2+) to agglutinate pathogenic bacteria and exhibited
      sugar-specificity to galactose, lactose, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and
      lipoteichoic acid (LTA). The ELISA-validated binding of rFmGal revealed higher
      affinity to LTA than LPS. rFmGal did not exhibit antibacterial activity but could
      enhance the phagocytosis and encapsulation of pathogenic invaders by hemocytes.
      Encapsulation was suppressed by galactose and lactose. Moreover, rFmGal also
      promoted the in vivo clearance of V. parahaemolyticus. FmGal, a galectin in F.
      merguiensis, participated in shrimp immunity, functioning as a PRR which might be
      involved in certain cellular responses.

AB  - The coronavirus disease pandemic is a constant reminder that global citizens are 
      in imminent danger of exposure to emerging infectious diseases. Therefore,
      developing a technique for inhibitor discovery is essential for effective drug
      design. Herein, we proposed fragment molecular orbital (FMO)-based virtual
      screening to predict the molecular binding energy of potential severe acute
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) main protease inhibitors. The
      integration of quantum mechanical approaches and trajectory analysis from a
      microsecond molecular dynamics simulation was used to identify potential
      inhibitors. We identified brominated baicalein as a potent inhibitor of the
      SARS-CoV-2 main protease and confirmed its inhibitory activity in an in vitro
      assay. Brominated baicalein did not demonstrate significant toxicity in either in
      vitro or in vivo studies. The pair interaction energy from FMO-RIMP2/PCM and
      inhibitory constants based on the protease enzyme assay suggested that the
      brominated baicalein could be further developed into novel SARS-CoV-2 protease
      inhibitors.

TI  - The Influence of Natural Barriers on the Amphidromous Shrimp Potimirim brasiliana
      (Caridea, Atyidae) from Two Rivers in Southeastern Brazil.
PG  - 27-39

AB  - AbstractThe migratory behavior of freshwater shrimps may be affected by natural
      barriers in limnetic environments. This study evaluated the river areas separated
      by natural barriers, such as waterfalls, which affect the amphidromous shrimps'
      (Potimirim brasiliana) population features and reproductive aspects. Results
      indicate that in the Felix and Prumirim Rivers from southeastern Brazil shrimps
      show few differences in sampling areas, and these differences may not be causally
      related to the waterfalls. This is demonstrated by the absence of a pattern in
      the size and sex ratio in each area and the absence of a significant difference
      in most reproductive aspects. The presence of juveniles and reproductive
      individuals in all sampling areas strongly indicates a constant migration along
      them in both rivers, indicating that all individuals evaluated correspond to one 
      single patchy population structure for each river. This migration conducted by P.
      brasiliana, such as its crawling behavior, demonstrated that it would be
      important to maintain the minimum number of individuals flowing between the
      different river sampling areas in this shrimp group. Thus, based on a helpful
      model observed in P. brasiliana, the results help us understand how natural
      barriers may affect the populations of amphidromous shrimp and how the migration 
      behavior up- and downstream can help sustain the population. This premise can
      help future construction decisions and impacts of unnatural barriers, such as
      dams.

TI  - Protective mechanisms of three antioxidants against T-2 toxin-induced muscle
      protein deterioration in shrimp.
PG  - 4883-4891
LID - 10.1002/jsfa.11851 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quercetin (Q), tea polyphenols (TP), and rutin (R) are widely used
      plant-derived active ingredients. They possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory,
      and anti-tumor properties, and can reduce the muscle damage caused by mycotoxins.
      However, few studies have examined the protective mechanisms of quercetin, tea
      polyphenols, and rutin on muscle quality. To elucidate their protective
      mechanisms, shrimp were exposed to both T-2 toxin and these three antioxidants
      for 20 days in a dose-escalating trial. The changes in the protein composition of
      shrimp muscle were measured. The target proteins associated with T-2 and
      antioxidants were screened and identified by non-labeled quantitative proteomics.
      RESULTS: The T-2 toxin induced abnormal expression of 21 target proteins, leading
      to the deterioration of muscle proteins in shrimp. The three antioxidants
      ameliorated the T-2 toxin-induced damage to muscle proteins by increasing the
      sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar protein content and decreasing the alkali-soluble
      protein content. Quercetin had the strongest protective effect. The protective
      processes of these antioxidants involved the upregulation of target proteins
      involved in carbohydrate metabolism (enolase, malate dehydrogenase), protein
      translation (elongation factor 1-alpha and eukaryotic translation initiation
      factor 2 subunit alpha), and cytoskeleton component (actin 2, fast-type skeletal 
      muscle actin 1). Quercetin regulated the largest number of target proteins,
      making it the best protective agent against T-2 toxin. CONCLUSION: The T-2 toxin 
      (4.80-24.30 mg/kg feed) induced changes in target proteins and muscle composition
      of shrimp, leading to a deterioration in muscle proteins. Quercetin (2.00-32.00
      g/kg feed) had significant protective effects against this deterioration in
      muscle protein in shrimp. (c) 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

TI  - Determining spoilage of whiteleg shrimp (Litopanaeus vannemei) during
      refrigerated storage using colorimetric strips.

AB  - A reliable spoilage assessment method is needed to ensure sufficient quality
      control of shrimp. Colorimetric dye-based indicators that change color in
      response to pH changes can monitor food quality changes in a simple, quick, and
      accurate way and generate easy-to-interpret results. Significant positive
      correlations with storage time were observed for the results of the bromophenol
      blue (BPB) strips (r = 0.8513, p < 0.0001) and the rose bengal strips (r =
      0.8981, p < 0.0001). The results of both colorimetric methods significantly
      correlated with sensory and chemical quality indicators, including sensory
      attributes "salty water-like", "natto water-like" and "sour milk-like", and
      volatile compounds such as 3-methyl-3-butenol, 2-methyl-1-butanol,
      3-methyl-1-butanol, hexanol, 2-methyl-1-butanal, and 3-methyl-1-butanal. The BPB 
      strips and rose bengal strips have the potential to be used as objective,
      accurate, and cost-efficient methods to evaluate shrimp quality and lead to
      consistent and easy-to-interpret results.

TI  - A High-Density Genetic Map and QTL Fine Mapping for Growth- and Sex-Related
      Traits in Red Swamp Crayfish (Procambarus clarkii).
PG  - 852280
LID - 10.3389/fgene.2022.852280 [doi]
AB  - Red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) is a commercially important species in
      global aquaculture and most successfully invasive freshwater shrimp in China. In 
      order to determine the genetic basis of growth- and sex-related traits, a
      high-density genetic linkage map was constructed using 2b-RAD sequencing
      technology in a full-sib family. The consensus map contains 4,878 SNP markers
      assigned to 94 linkage groups (LGs) and spanned 6,157.737 cM with an average
      marker interval of 1.26 cM and 96.93% genome coverage. The quantitative trait
      locus (QTL) mapping for growth and sex traits was performed for the first time.
      QTL mapping uncovers 28 QTLs for growth-related traits in nine LGs, explaining
      7.9-14.4% of the phenotypic variation, and identifies some potential candidate
      growth-related genes such as mih, lamr, golgb1, nurf301, and tbcd1 within the QTL
      intervals. A single major locus for sex determination was revealed in LG20 that
      explains 59.3-63.7% of the phenotypic variations. Some candidate sex-related
      genes, such as vps4bl, ssrf, and acot1, were identified in the QTL intervals and 
      found to be differentially expressed in the muscle tissues between the females
      and the males. Furthermore, the identified SNPs were revealed to be female
      heterozygotes, suggesting that red swamp crayfish might have the female
      heterogametic ZZ/ZW sex determination system. The present study provides a
      valuable resource for marker-assisted selection and genetic improvement and for
      further genetic and genomic research in red swamp crayfish.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of Intestinal Microflora Between Two Developmental Stages of

AB  - Despite extreme physical and chemical characteristics, deep-sea hydrothermal
      vents provide a place for fauna survival and reproduction. The symbiotic
      relationship of chemotrophic microorganisms has been investigated in the gill of 
      Rimicaris exoculata, which are endemic to the hydrothermal vents of the
      Mid-Atlantic Ridge. However, only a few studies have examined intestinal
      symbiosis. Here, we studied the intestinal fauna in juvenile and adult Rimicaris 
      kairei, another species in the Rimicaris genus that was originally discovered at 
      the Kairei and Edmond hydrothermal vent fields in the Central Indian Ridge. The
      results showed that there were significant differences between juvenile and adult
      gut microbiota in terms of species richness, diversity, and evenness. The values 
      of Chao1, observed species, and ASV rarefaction curves indicated almost four
      times the number of species in adults compared to juveniles. In juveniles, the
      most abundant phylum was Deferribacterota, at 80%, while in adults,
      Campilobacterota was the most abundant, at 49%. Beta diversity showed that the
      intestinal communities of juveniles and adults were clearly classified into two
      clusters based on the evaluations of Bray-Curtis and weighted UniFrac distance
      matrices. Deferribacteraceae and Sulfurovum were the main featured bacteria
      contributing to the difference. Moreover, functional prediction for all of the
      intestinal microbiota showed that the pathways related to ansamycin synthesis,
      branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis, lipid metabolism, and cell motility
      appeared highly abundant in juveniles. However, for adults, the most abundant
      pathways were those of sulfur transfer, carbohydrate, and biotin metabolism.
      Taken together, these results indicated large differences in intestinal microbial
      composition and potential functions between juvenile and adult vent shrimp (R.
      kairei), which may be related to their physiological needs at different stages of
      development.

      from the Okinawan soft coral Sinularia sp. Their chemical structures were
      elucidated based on spectroscopic analysis (FTIR, NMR, and HRESIMS), and the
      relative stereochemistry of 1 was determined by NOESY experiments and
      acetylation, which yielded derivative 2. In addition, compounds 1 and 7 exhibited
      toxicity in the brine shrimp lethality test.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Elemental profiling is a tool that has been proposed to improve the
      traceability of seafood products. Small sources of variation can affect the
      outcome of elemental profiling and therefore pose to lower the overall accuracy
      of analyses. Here, we investigate two potential sources of variation through
      three experiments: laboratory variation (intra-, interlaboratory variation, and
      tissue matrix) and tissue variation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Samples of whitleleg
      shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) were obtained from 20 farms in Ecuador and two
      farms in Alabama to be analyzed. In the first experiment of the study, samples
      from Ecuador were analyzed at three different laboratories and compared. Two out 
      of the five elements reported were statistically different across the three
      laboratories (Cu and Se). In the second experiment, the effect of tissue matrix
      (ground vs whole tissue during acid digestion) was investigated. Altogether, five
      out of 29 elements analyzed were statistically different. In the third
      experiment, samples from two farms in Alabama were analyzed to understand the
      variation in element concentrations in different tissues (head on shell on
      (HOSO), headless shell on (HLSO), headless peeled (PLD) and headless peeled and
      deveined (PLDV)). Elemental concentrations varied across tissues, and patterns in
      elemental concentrations were site specific. The samples from the two farms were 
      analyzed with a Random Forest classification model to site x tissue groupings
      with 94% accuracy. CONCLUSION: The result of this study highlights the following:
      1. Consistency in laboratory analysis important in studies that involve element
      concentrations, as minor differences in methodology can propagate as significant 
      differences in results. 2. In shrimp, elements are compartmentalized in different
      tissues and elemental profiling should consistently use the same type of tissue.

AB  - Habitat associations can be critical predictors of larger-scale organism
      distributions and range shifts. Here the authors consider how a critical habitat,
      kelp (Ecklonia radiata) and prey (mysid crustacean swarms), can influence small- 
      and large-scale distribution on the iconic common (weedy) seadragon (Phyllopteryx
      taeniolatus:Syngnathidae). P. taeniolatus are charismatic fish endemic to the
      temperate reefs of southern Australia, reported to range from Geraldton, Western 
      Australia (28.7667 degrees S, 114.6167 degrees E) around southern Australia to
      Port Stephens, New South Wales (32.614369 degrees S, 152.325676 degrees E). The
      authors test a previously developed model of seadragon habitat preferences to
      predict P. taeniolatus occurrence within four sites from Sydney to the northern
      limit of their range in eastern Australia. They determined that P. taeniolatus
      associations with Ecklonia and mysid shrimp can be extrapolated across multiple
      sites to predict the occurrence of individual P. taeniolatus within a
      location/site. For instance, the authors demonstrated a significant positive
      relationship between the density of mysid swarms and the density of P.
      taeniolatus, evident across all sites despite large differences in the density of
      mysid swarms among sites. The findings are the first to model P. taeniolatus
      habitat associations across multiple sites to the northern limit of their range
      and have applications in protecting P. taeniolatus populations and how they may
      respond under climate change scenarios, such as poleward kelp retractions.

AB  - A rapid on-site determination of hydrogensulfite in food is of great importance
      for our health. Herein, a novel benzoindole-based fluorescent probe tethered with
      hydroxyl groups was synthesized. The probe displayed a good selectivity, fast
      response time (<68 s), and low determination limit (0.72 muM) in solution. In
      order to prepare high performance test strips, various immobilization methods of 
      probes onto paper substrates were investigated, including physical absorption of 
      probe onto filter paper (test strip-1) and chemical immobilization of probe onto 
      BP-PAA-attached paper (test strip-2) or probe-attached BP-PAA onto paper (test
      strip-3). Results showed that the determination limit of test strip-2 was 9 muM, 
      which was lower than that of test strip-1 (55 muM) and test strip-3 (104 muM).
      This phenomenon could be due to the deposition of most probes on the paper
      surfaces in the test strip-2 instead of the whole 3D paper structure (test
      strip-1) or the upper half of paper (test strip-3), which facilitated their
      reaction with hydrogensulfite. In particular, the test strip-2 could rapidly
      determine the amount of bisulfide in white-rot fungus, shiitake mushroom, and
      dried shrimp with good recoveries (91.8-104.1%), indicating the great application
      prospect of our proposed fluorescent test strip.

TI  - Quantification and Antimicrobial Resistance of Vibrio parahaemolyticus in Retail 
      Seafood in Hanoi, Vietnam.

LID - 10.4315/JFP-21-444 [doi]
AB  - ABSTRACT: Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a major cause of foodborne diseases and a
      significant threat to human health worldwide. Most of the infections caused by V.
      parahaemolyticus are usually associated with the consumption of raw or
      undercooked seafood. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence,
      quantitative load, and antimicrobial resistance of V. parahaemolyticus in retail 
      seafood in Hanoi, Vietnam. A total of 120 seafood samples consisting of marine
      fish (n = 30), oysters (n = 30), shrimp (n = 30), and squid (n = 30) were
      purchased from different traditional markets in Hanoi between May and October
      2020. Isolation of V. parahaemolyticus was based on ISO/TS 21872-1:2017, and the 
      most-probable-number (MPN) method was used for quantification. The disk diffusion
      method was applied for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Overall, V.
      parahaemolyticus was detected in 58.33% of the samples. V. parahaemolyticus was
      most commonly isolated in shrimp samples, with a prevalence of 86.67%, followed
      by fish (53.33%), squid (53.33%), and oysters (40%). One V. parahaemolyticus
      isolate from an oyster carrying the trh gene was detected. Of the positive
      samples, 27.14% contained V. parahaemolyticus counts of less than 2 log MPN/g,
      whereas 44.29% ranged from 2 to 4 log MPN/g and 28.57% contained more than 4 log 
      MPN/g. Regarding antimicrobial resistance, 85.71% of V. parahaemolyticus isolates
      were resistant to at least one antibiotic tested. The highest rate of resistance 
      was observed against ampicillin (81.43%), followed by cefotaxime (11.43%),
      ceftazidime (11.43%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (8.57%), and tetracycline
      (2.86%). The results demonstrate the high prevalence and quantitative load and
      the antimicrobial resistance of V. parahaemolyticus isolated from seafood sold in
      the study area. HIGHLIGHTS:

TI  - Experimental Annealing of Zircon: Influence of Inclusions on Stability,
      Intracrystalline Melt Migration, Common Lead Leaching, and Permeability to
      Fluids.
PG  - 288-307
LID - 10.1021/acsearthspacechem.1c00212 [doi]
AB  - Zircon derived from crustal rocks can survive dissolution into hot basalts during
      magma hybridization and rock assimilation if it is shielded as an inclusion phase
      in early-formed phenocrysts or in minerals from non-disaggregated xenoliths.
      Under these conditions, zircon can be thermally shocked, triggering
      recrystallization of metamict domains and reaction with its hosted mineral
      inclusions. This work simulates this process by performing thermal annealing
      experiments on zircon grains with variable degrees of metamictization. These were
      embedded in cristobalite powder under a N2 atmosphere at 1 bar and 1300 degrees
      C. The thermal annealing produces recrystallization of metamict domains, melting 
      of multi-phase mineral inclusions, nanopore formation, and microcrack propagation
      by thermo-elastic stress. The porosity enhances intracrystalline melt mobility,
      leaching out trace-element and mineral impurities. Baddeleyite was formed at
      temperatures below the thermal decomposition of pure zircon by two mechanisms:
      (i) recrystallization of metamict domains assisted by silica migration from the
      reaction site and (ii) incongruent zircon dissolution into molten mineral
      inclusions with a high CaO/SiO2 ratio. Highly metamict zircons with elevated
      common Pb and radiogenic Pb loss, which were impossible to date with SHRIMP, lost
      all their common Pb and some radiogenic Pb upon annealing, producing well-fitted 
      discordias with a significant upper intercept age.

AB  - Shrimp aquaculture has been accomplished with breeding and nursing of shrimp in
      an artificial environment to fulfill the increasing demand of shrimp consumption 
      worldwide. However, the microbial diseases appear as a serious problem in this
      industry. The study was designed to identify the diverse bacteria from shrimp PL 
      (post-larvae) nurseries and to profile antibiotic resistance patterns. The
      rearing water (raw seawater, treated and outlet water) and shrimp PL were
      collected from eight nurseries of south-west Bangladesh. Using selective agar
      plates, thirty representative isolates were selected for 16S rRNA gene
      sequencing, antibiotic susceptibility test and MAR index calculation.
      Representative isolates were identified as Aeromonas caviae, Pseudomonas
      monteilii, Shewanella algae, Vibrio alginolyticus, V. brasiliensis, V.
      natriegens, V. parahaemolyticus, V. shilonii, V. xuii, Zobellella denitrificans
      which are Gram-negative, and Bacillus licheniformis and B. pumilus which are
      Gram-positive. Notably, six strains identified as Acinetobacter venetianus might 
      be a concern of risk for shrimp industry. The antibiotic resistance pattern
      reveals that the strain YWO8-97 (identified as P. monteilii) was resistant to all
      twelve antibiotics. Ceftazidime was the most powerful antibiotic since most of
      the studied strains were sensitive against it. The six strains of A. venetianus
      showed multiple antibiotic resistance patterns. MAR index were ranged from 0.08
      to 1.0, and values of 26 isolates were more than 0.2 which means prior high
      exposure to the antibiotics. From the present study, it can be concluded that
      shrimp PL nurseries in southern part of Bangladesh are getting contaminated with 
      antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria.

AB  - Litopenaeus vannamei is the major farmed shrimp species worldwide. White spot
      disease due to white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is severely affecting shrimp
      worldwide, causing extensive economic losses in L. vannamei culture. This is the 
      first study that applied combined transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis to
      study the effects on the L. vannamei hepatopancreas after WSSV challenge. Our
      transcriptomic data revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated
      with immunity, apoptosis, the cytoskeleton and the antioxidant system in the
      hepatopancreas of L. vannamei. Metabolomic results showed that WSSV disrupts
      metabolic processes including amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism and
      nucleotide metabolism. After challenged by WSSV, immune-related DEGs and
      differential metabolites (DMs) were detected in the hepatopancreas of L.
      vannamei, indicating that WSSV may damage the immune system and cause metabolic
      disorder in the shrimp. In summary, these results provide new insights into the
      molecular mechanisms underlying L. vannamei's response to WSSV.

AB  - The present work aims to evaluate the removal capacity of Rhodamine B dye (RhB)
      using nano-porous chitosan (NC) from shrimp shells. NC was characterized by XRD, 
      SEM-EDS, N2 porosimetry, zeta potential (ZP), FTIR, DLS, and zero charge point
      (pHZCP). Compound central rotational design (CCRD) was used to determine the
      ideal condition and antimicrobial activity was evaluated against different
      strains. NC showed characteristic of semi-crystalline material with negative
      charge surface (around - 21.13 mV), and SBET = 1.12 m(2) g(-1), Vp = 0.0064 cm(3)
      g(-1), Dp = 32.09 nm and pHZCP approximately 7.98. Kinetic adsorption showed the 
      pseudo first-order model had the best fit, with adsorption capacity (q1) between 
      3.78 and 64.43 mg g(-1) and pseudo first-order kinetic constant (k1) between
      0.066 and 0.052 min(-1). Sips model best described the equilibrium data, with a
      maximum adsorption capacity of 505.131 mg g(-1). Antimicrobial activity was
      observed at 0.25 mg mL(-1) for different strains. Therefore, NC has potential
      application in the removal of the dye, combining sustainable development
      associated with nanotechnology.

AB  - An important challenge to decrease the toxic effects of the common biocides in
      marine environments and to achieve suitable ecofriendly natural antifouling
      coatings is to find effective natural antifoulants and efficient biodegradable
      coatings. In this study, antifouling activities of nine bioactive extracts
      (non-polar to polar) from different organs of the sea cucumber Stichopus
      herrmanni were tested against five bacterial strains, barnacle and brine shrimp
      larvae. The ethyl acetate extract of the body wall showed the highest in-vitro
      antifouling activity including high antibacterial and anti-barnacle activities
      and low toxicity against the brine shrimp as non-target organism. Based on these 
      results, 10 phr of the ethyl acetate extract from S.herrmanni was added to
      different coatings consisting of polycaprolactone (PCL)/polylactic acid (PLA)
      blends containing various compositions of PLA (0, 10, and 20 wt.%). Polyvinyl
      chloride panels were coated with the prepared antifouling coatings and immersed
      in seawater for three months. Panel coated with PCL 80% /PLA 20% containing 10
      phr of the antifoulant (panel-5), showed the highest resistance against fouling
      settlement with fouling coverage of 41.66% (P < 0.05). In addition, the lowest
      fouling weight was measured in panel-5 as well (81.00 +/- 9.85 g) (P < 0.05).
      These findings indicate the antibacterial and antifouling potential of semi-polar
      bioactive extracts from the S. herrmanni body wall as natural antifoulants, as
      well as the enhanced antifouling performance of PCL/the natural antifoulant
      coatings by adding PLA.

AB  - Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) is a life-threatening disease to 
      recently stocked shrimp. This disease is mainly caused by Vibrio parahaemolyticus
      and, to date, it has not been effectively controlled. Bacteriophages are a
      promising method to control bacterial diseases in aquaculture and multiple phages
      that infect Asian strains of V. parahaemolyticus have been described. However,
      few studies have characterized the bacteriophages that infect Latin American
      strains. Here, two lytic Vibrio phages (vB_VpaP_AL-1 and vB_VpaS_AL-2) were
      isolated from estuary water in Sinaloa, Mexico. The host ranges were tested using
      ten AHPND-causing strains isolated from Mexico and phage AL-1 was able to infect 
      two strains while AL-2 infected four. One-step growth curve showed that AL-1
      produced 85 PFU/cell and AL-2 produced 68 PFU/cell in 30 and 40 min,
      respectively. Both phages were able to tolerate temperatures ranging from 20 to
      50 degrees C and pH values ranging from 4 to 10. Phages AL-1 and AL-2 have
      double-stranded DNA genomes of 42,854 bp and 58,457 bp, respectively. In total,
      53 putative ORFs associated with the phage structure, packing, host lysis, DNA
      metabolism, and additional functions were predicted in the AL-1 genome, while 92 
      ORFs associated with the same functions as the AL-1 and 1 tRNA were predicted in 
      the AL-2 genome. The lifecycle was classified as virulent for both phages.
      Morphology, phylogeny, and comparative genomic analyses assigned phage AL-1 as a 
      new member of the genus Maculvirus in the Autographiviridae family, and phage
      AL-2 as a new member of the Siphoviridae family. These findings suggest that
      vB_VpaP_AL-1 and vB_VpaS_AL-2 are potential biocontrol agents against
      AHPND-causing V. parahaemolyticus from Mexico.

TI  - Effect of household culinary processes on organochlorine pesticide residues
      (OCPs) in the seafood (Penaeus vannamei) and its associated human health risk
      assessment: Our vision and future scope.

AB  - Food safety is crucial in today's competitive trading market, as it directly
      affects human health and promotes seafood exports. The effects of thermal
      processing (boiling, frying, grilling, and microwave cooking) on pesticide
      residues (PR) in P. vannamei were assessed. The PR in raw and processed shrimp
      ranged from 0.007 to 0.703 mug/kg for uncooked/raw, not detected (ND) to 0.917
      mug/kg for boiled, ND to 0.506 mug/kg for fried, ND to 0.573 mug/kg for grilled
      and ND to 0.514 mug/kg for microwave cooked shrimps. The Endrin, endosulfan
      sulfate, and heptachlor were predominant PR found in the raw and processed
      shrimp. The PR content in raw and cooked shrimps were below the maximum residue
      limits (MRL) set by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (2021) and the European
      Commission (86/363/1986 and 57/2007). The estimated daily intake (EDI) of PR from
      raw and processed shrimps were below the ADI prescribed by CAC. The hazard
      quotient (HQ) and hazard ratio (HR) values were <1, indicating no
      non-carcinogenic or carcinogenic health implications through shrimp consumption. 
      The estimated maximum allowable shrimp consumption rate (CRlim) suggests an adult
      can eat >100 shrimp meals/month, which is over the USEPA's (2000)recommendation
      of >16 meals/month without health issues. The Effect of thermal processing was
      detected in the following order: boiling < grilling < frying < microwave cooking.
      The processing factor (PF < 0.7), paired t-test (t < 0.05), Tukey post hoc (p <
      0.05) test, Bray-Curtis similarity index, and matrix plot exhibited that all the 
      four thermal processing methods have a considerable impact on pesticides in the
      processed shrimps. But frying (59.4%) and microwave cooking (60.3%) reduced PR
      far beyond boiling (48.8%) and grilling (51.3%). Hence, we recommend frying and
      microwave processing are better methods for minimizing PR in seafood than boiling
      or grilling.

AB  - A Gram-stain-negative and facultatively anaerobic bacterial strain designated as 
      JM162201(T) was isolated from aquaculture water for farming Pacific white shrimp 
      (Litopenaeus vannamei). The genome size of strain JM162201(T) was 4,436,316 bp,
      and the genomic DNA G + C content was 55.0%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S
      rRNA gene sequences and genomes showed that strain JM162201(T) belonged to the
      genus Shewanella and was closely related to Shewanella litorisediminis SMK1-12(T)
      (97.1%), Shewanella khirikhana TH2012(T) (97.0%), and Shewanella amazonensis
      SB2B(T) (96.0%). The average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA-DNA
      hybridization (dDDH) values between strain JM162201(T) and three reference type
      strains were below the recognized thresholds of 95.0-96.0% (for ANI) and 70.0%
      (for dDDH) for species delineation. Growth occurred at 10-40 degrees C (optimum, 
      30 degrees C), at pH 4.0-10.0 (optimum, 7.0-8.0), and in 0-6.0% NaCl (w/v,
      optimum, 0-0.1%). The major cellular fatty acids of strain JM162201(T) were
      summed feature 3 (C16:1 omega7c and/or C16:1 omega6c), C17:1 omega8c, iso-C15:0, 
      C16:0, and C15:0. The predominant quinones were MK7, Q-7, and Q-8. The major
      polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG).
      Based on the polyphasic taxonomical analyses, strain JM162201(T) represents a
      novel species of the genus Shewanella, for which the name Shewanella
      jiangmenensis sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain JM162201(T) (= GDMCC
      1.2006(T) = KCTC 82340(T)).

AB  - This study aimed at evaluating the effect of one generation of full-sibling
      mating on traits related to the fitness of the gregarious freshwater shrimp
      Neocaridina davidi, both under optimal and stressful (i.e. starvation) laboratory
      conditions. Females were maintained either with their brothers (Inbreeding
      treatment) or non-brothers (Outbreeding treatment), and the first and second
      broods were used to evaluate egg production and juvenile quality, respectively.
      The latter was analyzed in a 60-day period following hatching under optimal
      rearing conditions, and in a 20-day period following hatching under food
      deprivation conditions. All surviving females from both treatments mated and
      spawned, indicating that mating with brothers was as likely as mating with
      non-brothers. With respect to offspring production, inbreeding had no effect on
      fecundity and fertilization success, but negatively affected the number of
      hatched juveniles. These results suggest that egg loss was higher in inbred
      clutches, possibly due to lower embryonic survival. On the other hand, the effect
      of inbreeding on growth was absent for embryos and for juveniles under optimal
      rearing conditions, while it was significant for juveniles starved for 10
      consecutive days following hatching. Inbreeding depression for survival was only 
      detected in juveniles from stages S8-S9 under optimal rearing conditions.
      Overall, the present results show that N. davidi fitness decreases after one
      generation of full-sibling mating. The use of a potentially weak food deprivation
      protocol and/or the evaluation of only one inbred generation could explain the
      absence or subtle inbreeding depression for some of the evaluated traits. No
      evident relationship between life-history traits and the existence and magnitude 
      of inbreeding was found when comparing our results with those previously reported
      in high-fecundity marine crustaceans and low-fecundity terrestrial crustaceans.

TI  - Reservoirs of Red-Spotted Grouper Nervous Necrosis Virus (RGNNV) in Squid and
      Shrimp Species of Northern Alboran Sea.
LID - 328 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14020328 [doi]
AB  - The production of the aquaculture industry has increased to be equal to that of
      the world fisheries in recent years. However, aquaculture production faces
      threats such as infectious diseases. Betanodaviruses induce a neurological
      disease that affects fish species worldwide and is caused by nervous necrosis
      virus (NNV). NNV has a nude capsid protecting a bipartite RNA genome that
      consists of molecules RNA1 and RNA2. Four NNV strains distributed worldwide are
      discriminated according to sequence homology of the capsid protein encoded by
      RNA2. Since its first description over 30 years ago, the virus has expanded and
      reassortant strains have appeared. Preventive treatments prioritize the RGNNV
      (red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus) strain that has the highest optimum 
      temperature for replication and the broadest range of susceptible species. There 
      is strong concern about the spreading of NNV in the mariculture industry through 
      contaminated diet. To surveil natural reservoirs of NNV in the western
      Mediterranean Sea, we collected invertebrate species in 2015 in the Alboran Sea. 
      We report the detection of the RGNNV strain in two species of cephalopod mollusks
      (Alloteuthis media and Abralia veranyi), and in one decapod crustacean
      (Plesionika heterocarpus). According to RNA2 sequences obtained from invertebrate
      species and reported to date in the Mediterranean Sea, the strain RGNNV is
      predominant in this semienclosed sea. Neither an ecosystem- nor host-driven
      distribution of RGNNV were observed in the Mediterranean basin.

TI  - Early Introduction of Multi-Allergen Mixture for Prevention of Food Allergy:
      Pilot Study.
LID - 737 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14040737 [doi]
AB  - The incidence and prevalence of food allergy (FA) is increasing. While several
      studies have established the safety and efficacy of early introduction of single 
      allergens in infants for the prevention of FA, the exact dose, frequency, and
      number of allergens that can be safely introduced to infants, particularly in
      those at high or low risk of atopy, are still unclear. This 1-year pilot study
      evaluated the safety of the early introduction of single foods (milk, egg, or
      peanut) vs. two foods (milk/egg, egg/peanut, milk/peanut) vs. multiple foods
      (milk/egg/peanut/cashew/almond/shrimp/walnut/wheat/salmon/hazelnut at low,
      medium, or high doses) vs. no early introduction in 180 infants between 4-6
      months of age. At the end of the study, they were evaluated for plasma biomarkers
      associated with food reactivity via standardized blood tests. Two to four years
      after the start of the study, participants were evaluated by standardized food
      challenges. The serving sizes for the single, double, and low dose mixtures were 
      300 mg total protein per day. The serving sizes for the medium and high dose
      mixtures were 900 mg and 3000 mg total protein, respectively. Equal parts of each
      protein were used for double or mixture foods. All infants were breastfed until
      at least six months of age. The results demonstrate that infants at either high
      or low risk for atopy were able to tolerate the early introduction of multiple
      allergenic foods with no increases in any safety issues, including eczema, FA, or
      food protein induced enterocolitis. The mixtures of foods at either low, medium, 
      or high doses demonstrated trends for improvement in food challenge reactivity
      and plasma biomarkers compared to single and double food introductions. The
      results of this study suggest that the early introduction of foods, particularly 
      simultaneous mixtures of many allergenic foods, may be safe and efficacious for
      preventing FA and can occur safely. These results need to be confirmed by larger 
      randomized controlled studies.

TI  - Immunization of Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) Broodstock with Tilapia Lake
      Virus (TiLV) Inactivated Vaccines Elicits Protective Antibody and Passive
      Maternal Antibody Transfer.
LID - 167 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vaccines10020167 [doi]
AB  - Tilapia lake virus (TiLV), a major pathogen of farmed tilapia, is known to be
      vertically transmitted. Here, we hypothesize that Nile tilapia (Oreochromis
      niloticus) broodstock immunized with a TiLV inactivated vaccine can mount a
      protective antibody response and passively transfer maternal antibodies to their 
      fertilized eggs and larvae. To test this hypothesis, three groups of tilapia
      broodstock, each containing four males and eight females, were immunized with
      either a heat-killed TiLV vaccine (HKV), a formalin-killed TiLV vaccine (FKV)
      (both administered at 3.6 x 10(6) TCID50 per fish), or with L15 medium. Booster
      vaccination with the same vaccines was given 3 weeks later, and mating took place
      1 week thereafter. Broodstock blood sera, fertilized eggs and larvae were
      collected from 6-14 weeks post-primary vaccination for measurement of
      TiLV-specific antibody (anti-TiLV IgM) levels. In parallel, passive immunization 
      using sera from the immunized female broodstock was administered to naive tilapia
      juveniles to assess if antibodies induced in immunized broodstock were
      protective. The results showed that anti-TiLV IgM was produced in the majority of
      both male and female broodstock vaccinated with either the HKV or FKV and that
      these antibodies could be detected in the fertilized eggs and larvae from
      vaccinated broodstock. Higher levels of maternal antibody were observed in
      fertilized eggs from broodstock vaccinated with HKV than those vaccinated with
      FKV. Low levels of TiLV-IgM were detected in some of the 1-3 day old larvae but
      were undetectable in 7-14 day old larvae from the vaccinated broodstock,
      indicating a short persistence of TiLV-IgM in larvae. Moreover, passive
      immunization proved that antibodies elicited by TiLV vaccination were able to
      confer 85% to 90% protection against TiLV challenge in naive juvenile tilapia. In
      conclusion, immunization of tilapia broodstock with TiLV vaccines could be a
      potential strategy for the prevention of TiLV in tilapia fertilized eggs and
      larvae, with HKV appearing to be more promising than FKV for maternal
      vaccination.

TI  - Antioxidant and Toxic Activity of Helichrysum arenarium (L.) Moench and
      Helichrysum italicum (Roth) G. Don Essential Oils and Extracts.
LID - 1311 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27041311 [doi]
AB  - Helichrysum arenarium (L.) Moench (sandy everlasting) is the only species from
      genus Helichrysum Mill that grows spontaneously in Lithuania. The chemical
      composition of the essential oils (EOs) from inflorescences and leaves of H.
      arenarium wild plants was analysed by GC-MS. Palmitic (</=23.8%), myristic
      (</=14.9%) and lauric (6.1%) acids, n-nonanal (10.4%), and
      trans-beta-caryophyllene (</=6.5%) were the major constituents in the EOs. For
      comparison, the main components in EO from flowers (commercial herb material) of 
      H.italicum were gamma-curcumene (21.5%), beta-selinene (13.6%), alpha-selinene
      (8.1%), beta-eudesmol (8.3%), and alpha-pinene (6.5%). Composition of H.
      arenarium methanolic extracts was investigated by HPLC-DAD-TOF. The main
      compounds were the following: luteolin-7-O-glucoside, naringenin and its
      glucoside, apigenin, chlorogenic acid, arenol, and arzanol. Antioxidant activity 
      of EOs and extracts was tested by DPPH() and ABTS(+) assays. Sandy everlasting
      extracts exhibited significantly higher radical scavenging activities (for leaves
      11.18 to 19.13 and for inflorescences 1.96 to 6.13 mmol/L TROLOX equivalent)
      compared to those of all tested EOs (0.25 to 0.46 mmol/L TROLOX equivalent).
      Antioxidant activity, assayed electrochemically by cyclic and square wave
      voltammetry correlated with total polyphenolic content in extracts and radical
      scavenging properties of EOs and extracts. The toxic activity of EOs of both
      Helichrysum species was evaluated using a brine shrimp (Artemia salina) bioassay.
      H. italicum inflorescence EO was found to be toxic (LC50 = 15.99 microg/mL) as
      well as that of H. arenarium (LC50 </= 23.42 microg/mL) oils.

AB  - Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei, a spore-forming and obligate intracellular

      industry. However, the lack of a full understanding of the surface proteins of
      spores associated with host infection has hindered the development of
      technologies for the detection of EHP. In this study, the surface proteins of EHP
      spores were extracted using the improved SDS method, and 130 proteins were
      identified via LC-MS/MS analysis. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that these
      proteins were enriched in biological processes (67), cellular components (62),
      and molecular functions (71) based on GO terms. KEGG pathway analysis showed that
      20 pathways, including the proteasome (eight proteins) and the fatty acid
      metabolism (15 proteins), were enriched. Among 15 high-abundance surface proteins
      (HASPs), EhSWP3 was identified as a novel spore wall protein (SWP), and was
      localized on the endospore of the EHP spores with an indirect immunofluorescence 
      and immunoelectron microscopy assay. Polyclonal antibodies against EhSWP3 showed 
      strong species specificity and high sensitivity to the hepatopancreas of
      EHP-infected shrimp. As a specific high-abundance protein, EhSWP3 is therefore a 
      promising target for the development of immunoassay tools for EHP detection, and 
      may play a crucial role in the invasion of EHP into the host.

TI  - Probiotic Effects of a Marine Purple Non-Sulfur Bacterium, Rhodovulum

AB  - Purple non-sulfur bacteria (PNSB) are used as probiotics in shrimp aquaculture;
      however, no studies have examined the probiotic effects of PNSB in shrimp at the 
      gene expression level. In this study, we examined the effects of a marine PNSB,
      Rhodovulum sulfidophilum KKMI01, on the gene expression of kuruma shrimp
      (Marsupenaeus japonicus). Short-term (3 days) effects of R. sulfidophilum KKMI01 
      on the gene expression in shrimp were examined using small-scale laboratory
      aquaria experiments, while long-term (145 days) effects of R. sulfidophilum
      KKMI01 on the growth performance and gene expression were examined using 200-ton 
      outdoor aquaria experiments. Gene expression levels were examined using qRT-PCR. 
      Results of the short-term experiments showed the upregulation of several
      molting-related genes, including cuticle proteins, calcification proteins, and
      cuticle pigment protein, suggesting that PNSB stimulated the growth of shrimp.
      The upregulation of several immune genes, such as prophenoloxidase, antimicrobial
      peptides, and superoxide dismutase, was also observed. In the 145-day outdoor
      experiments, the average body weight at harvest time, survival rate, and feed
      conversion ratio were significantly improved in PNSB-treated shrimp, and
      upregulation of molting and immune-related genes were also observed. When PNSB
      cells were added to the rearing water, the effective dosage of PNSB was as low as
      10(3) cfu/mL, which was more than a million times dilution of the original PNSB
      culture (2-3 x 10(9) cfu/mL), indicating that R. sulfidophilum KKMI01 provides a 
      feasible and cost-effective application as a probiotic candidate in shrimp
      aquaculture.

TI  - Dynamic Changes in the Bacterial Community and Metabolic Profile during
      Fermentation of Low-Salt Shrimp Paste (Terasi).
LID - 118 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/metabo12020118 [doi]
AB  - Low-salt shrimp paste, or terasi, is an Indonesian fermented food made from
      planktonic shrimp mixed with a low concentration of salt. Since high daily intake
      of sodium is deemed unhealthy, reduction of salt content in shrimp paste
      production is desired. Until now, there is no reported investigation on the
      bacterial population and metabolite composition of terasi during fermentation. In
      this study, the bacterial community of terasi was assessed using high-throughput 
      sequencing of the 16S rRNA V3-V4 region. From this analysis, Tetragenococcus,
      Aloicoccus, Alkalibacillus, Atopostipes, and Alkalibacterium were found to be the
      dominant bacterial genus in low-salt shrimp paste. GC/MS-based metabolite
      profiling was also conducted to monitor the metabolite changes during shrimp
      paste fermentation. Results showed that acetylated amino acids increased, while
      glutamine levels decreased, during the fermentation of low-salt shrimp paste. At 
      the start of shrimp paste fermentation, Tetragenococcus predominated with
      histamine and cadaverine accumulation. At the end of fermentation, there was an
      increase in 4-hydroxyphenyl acetic acid and indole-3-acetic acid levels, as well 
      as the predominance of Atopostipes. Moreover, we found that aspartic acid
      increased during fermentation. Based on our findings, we recommend that
      fermentation of low-salt shrimp paste be done for 7 to 21 days, in order to
      produce shrimp paste that has high nutritional content and reduced health risk.

      Easy-to-Operate and Highly Sensitive Infectious Disease Detection System for
      Shrimp.
LID - 276 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/life12020276 [doi]
AB  - Infectious diseases are considered the greatest threat to the modern high-density
      shrimp aquaculture industry. Specificity, rapidity, and sensitivity of molecular 
      diagnostic methods for the detection of asymptomatic infected shrimp allows
      preventive measures to be taken before disease outbreaks. Routine molecular
      detection of pathogens in infected shrimp can be made easier with the use of a
      direct polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In this study, four direct PCR reagent
      brands were tested, and results showed that the detection signal of direct PCR in
      hepatopancreatic tissue was more severely affected. In addition, portable
      capillary electrophoresis was applied to improve sensitivity and specificity,
      resulting in a pathogen detection limit of 25 copies/PCR-reaction. Juvenile
      shrimp from five different aquaculture ponds were tested for white spot syndrome 
      virus infection, and the results were consistent with the Organization for Animal
      Health's certified standard method. Furthermore, this methodology could be used
      to examine single post larvae shrimp. The overall detection time was reduced by
      more than 58.2%. Therefore, the combination of direct PCR and capillary
      electrophoresis for on-site examination is valuable and has potential as a
      suitable tool for diagnostic, epidemiological, and pathological studies of shrimp
      aquaculture.

TI  - Transcriptome Analysis of Halotolerant Staphylococcus saprophyticus Isolated from
      Korean Fermented Shrimp.
LID - 524 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/foods11040524 [doi]
AB  - Saeu-jeotgal, a Korean fermented shrimp food, is commonly used as an ingredient
      for making kimchi and other side dishes. The high salinity of the jeotgal
      contributes to its flavor and inhibits the growth of food spoilage
      microorganisms. Interestingly, Staphylococcus saprophyticus was discovered to be 
      capable of growth even after treatment with 20% NaCl. To elucidate the tolerance 
      mechanism, a genome-wide gene expression of S. saprophyticus against 0%, 10%, and
      20% NaCl was investigated by RNA sequencing. A total of 831, 1314, and 1028
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the 0% vs. 10%, 0% vs.
      20%, and 10% vs. 20% NaCl comparisons, respectively. The Clusters of Orthologous 
      Groups analysis revealed that the DEGs were involved in amino acid transport and 
      metabolism, transcription, and inorganic ion transport and metabolism. The
      functional enrichment analysis showed that the expression of the genes encoding
      mechanosensitive ion channels, sodium/proton antiporters, and
      betaine/carnitine/choline transporter family proteins was downregulated, whereas 
      the expression of the genes encoding universal stress proteins and enzymes for
      glutamate, glycine, and alanine synthesis was upregulated. Therefore, these
      findings suggest that the S. saprophyticus isolated from the saeu-jeotgal
      utilizes different molecular strategies for halotolerance, with glutamate as the 
      key molecule.

AB  - Oyster shell waste has led to many problems, including displeasing odors,

      shells as a natural preservative might solve the problem of oyster shell waste.
      We studied the use of calcined oyster shell powder (COSP) as a natural
      preservative for improving shrimp shelf-life over 12 days under refrigerated
      conditions. As compared with the control, COSP treatment effectively retarded pH 
      change, reduced the formation of total volatile basic nitrogen, and inhibited
      bacterial growth during refrigerated storage. In addition, shrimp muscle lipid
      oxidation measured by peroxide value (PV) and thiobarbituric acid (TBA) was
      decreased during storage. The quality was preserved up to 12 days with 2.0-4.0%
      COSP treatment as compared with only 6 days for un-treated shrimp. The
      development of preservatives for aquatic products is expected to delay growth of 
      and spoilage by microorganisms in the refrigerated state, thus providing more
      barrier protection for aquatic food safety.

AB  - This study assessed the feeding habits and ingestion of anthropogenic debris in
      34 marine fish species from the southern Gulf of Thailand. A total of 5478 fish
      samples of 12 families were categorised into seven groups: planktivore, Lucifer
      feeder, fish feeder, Acetes feeder, shrimp feeder, piscivore, and zoobenthivore
      fish. A total of 2477 anthropogenic debris items were extracted from 12 fish
      species by visual inspection. Their ingestion of anthropogenic debris was
      influenced by season (p < 0.0001), with the highest ingestion during the
      northeast monsoon season. Furthermore, planktivorous fish displayed more ingested
      anthropogenic debris than the other investigated species (p = 0.022).
      Blue-coloured anthropogenic debris was commonly detected in the stomachs of fish 
      and significantly differed between species (p > 0.001). Water depth and season
      significantly influenced the availability of food types (AF) for fish (p <
      0.001). These findings provide evidence of the ingestion of anthropogenic debris 
      by fish inhabiting a natural bay and signal the future anthropogenic pollution of
      marine fish.

AB  - A new amine moiety-based near-infrared fluorescent probe (Probe-NH2) is developed
      for detection of formaldehyde in food samples and mice. Probe-NH2 is constructed 
      and synthesized from the IR-780 via two-step reactions as a hemicyanine skeleton 
      bearing an amino moiety. The response mechanism is based on Schiff base reaction 
      that formaldehyde reacts with amine group to form the corresponding imines.
      Probe-NH2 for detection of formaldehyde exhibits excellent analytical
      performance, including near-infrared fluorescence emission at 708 nm, high
      selectivity and sensitivity, also provides a response time as low as 30 min with 
      a detection limit of 1.87 mumolL(-1). Notably, we constructed a simple, rapid and
      visual formaldehyde detection platform based on paper chips in the near-infrared 
      region for the first time. The accurate detection of formaldehyde in real food
      samples is of great significance, Probe-NH2 was detected in dried beancurd
      sticks, endive sprout, frozen shrimp and squid, with good recoveries of
      99.60%-112.72%, indicating the reliability of Probe-NH2 for spiked determination 
      of formaldehyde in contaminated foods. More importantly, Probe-NH2 has been
      successfully applied to the detection of endogenous formaldehyde in mice.

TI  - Biotechnological Enhancement of Probiotics through Co-Cultivation with Algae:
      Future or a Trend?
LID - 142 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/md20020142 [doi]
AB  - The diversity of algal species is a rich source of many different bioactive
      metabolites. The compounds extracted from algal biomass have various beneficial
      effects on health. Recently, co-culture systems between microalgae and bacteria
      have emerged as an interesting solution that can reduce the high contamination
      risk associated with axenic cultures and, consequently, increase biomass yield
      and synthesis of active compounds. Probiotic microorganisms also have numerous
      positive effects on various aspects of health and represent potent co-culture
      partners. Most studies consider algae as prebiotics that serve as enhancers of
      probiotics performance. However, the extreme diversity of algal organisms and
      their ability to produce a plethora of metabolites are leading to new
      experimental designs in which these organisms are cultivated together to derive
      maximum benefit from their synergistic interactions. The future success of these 
      studies depends on the precise experimental design of these complex systems. In
      the last decade, the development of high-throughput approaches has enabled a
      deeper understanding of global changes in response to interspecies interactions. 
      Several studies have shown that the addition of algae, along with probiotics, can
      influence the microbiota, and improve gut health and overall yield in fish,
      shrimp, and mussels aquaculture. In the future, such findings can be further
      explored and implemented for use as dietary supplements for humans.

TI  - Applications of Fluorescence Spectroscopy, RGB- and MultiSpectral Imaging for
      Quality Determinations of White Meat: A Review.
LID - 76 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/bios12020076 [doi]
AB  - Fluorescence spectroscopy, color imaging and multispectral imaging (MSI) have
      emerged as effective analytical methods for the non-destructive detection of
      quality attributes of various white meat products such as fish, shrimp, chicken, 
      duck and goose. Based on machine learning and convolutional neural network, these
      techniques can not only be used to determine the freshness and category of white 
      meat through imaging and analysis, but can also be used to detect various harmful
      substances in meat products to prevent stale and spoiled meat from entering the
      market and causing harm to consumer health and even the ecosystem. The
      development of quality inspection systems based on such techniques to measure and
      classify white meat quality parameters will help improve the productivity and
      economic efficiency of the meat industry, as well as the health of consumers.
      Herein, a comprehensive review and discussion of the literature on fluorescence
      spectroscopy, color imaging and MSI is presented. The principles of these three
      techniques, the quality analysis models selected and the research results of
      non-destructive determinations of white meat quality over the last decade or so
      are analyzed and summarized. The review is conducted in this highly practical
      research field in order to provide information for future research directions.
      The conclusions detail how these efficient and convenient imaging and analytical 
      techniques can be used for non-destructive quality evaluation of white meat in
      the laboratory and in industry.

TI  - Xanthone C-glycosides isomers purified from Dryopteris ramosa (Hope) C. Chr. with
      bactericidal and cytotoxic prospects.
PG  - 1191-1196
LID - 10.1016/j.sjbs.2021.09.047 [doi]
AB  - Xanthones C-glycosides are plants secondary metabolites with diverse biological
      activities. Among the C-glycoside xanthones, the mangiferin (MF) is of widespread
      occurrence in plants while isomangiferin (IsoMF) is not very common. For the
      present study mangiferin (MF) and isomangiferin (IsoMF) were isolated from
      Dryopteris ramosa. The antibacterial potential of MF and IsoMF was evaluated by
      using agar well diffusion method while cytotoxic properties of MF and IsoMF were 
      assessed by brine shrimp lethality test (BSLT). The antibacterial potential of MF
      and IsoMF increases in dose dependent manner. The minimum inhibitory
      concentration (MIC) indicated strong antibacterial potential of MF against
      Salmonella setubal (125 microg/mL) and Bacillus subtilis (125 microg/mL) while MF
      showed weak antibacterial potential against Escherichia coli (500 microg/mL). On 
      the other hand the IsoMF showed better antibacterial potential against all the
      tested strain including Escherichia coli (MIC = 250 microg/mL). The MF and IsoMF 
      showed poor cytotoxicity towards Brine shrimp nauplii as indicated by their LD50 
      (969.77 +/- 0.67 and 768.92 +/- 0.81 microg/mL respectively). The present study
      has highlighted the antibacterial potential of MF and IsoMF. Further evaluation
      of these two isomeric compounds may prove to be the future remedies for various
      bacterial infections and other human ailments.

AB  - Medicinal plants have significant contribution in pharmaceutical industries being
      producers of compounds utilized as precursors for drug development. A plant of
      Lamiaceae family; Pseudocaryopteris foetida had not been investigated for its
      biomedical potential. Current research was aimed to investigate phytochemical
      analysis, cytotoxic potential and antioxidant activity of crude methanolic
      extract and fractions of Pseudocaryopteris foetida (leaves). The preliminary
      phytochemical analysis of crude methanolic extracts and fractions of
      Pseudocaryopteris foetida revealed that plant is rich in phenolic and flavonoid
      classes of secondary metabolites while presence of tannin was observed only in
      crude methanolic extract. The cytotoxicity was determined using brine shrimp
      lethality test. Different concentrations (25, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250
      microg/mL) of crude methanolic extract and fractions exhibited dose dependent
      cytotoxicity. However, The LD50 for all the extracts was more than 200 microg/mL 
      indicating weak cytotoxic potential of Pseudocaryopteris foetida. The antioxidant
      capabilities of crude methanolic extract and fraction of Pseudocaryopteris
      foetida were analyzed by in vitro bio assays including DPPH, ABTS, Reducing power
      and phosphomolybdate antioxidant assays using ascorbic acid as standard. The
      crude methanolic extract showed IC50 (256.38 +/- 0.6 and 314.95 +/- 1.1
      microg/mL) for DPPH and ABTS respectively, while total antioxidant capacity was
      calculated as 55.79 +/- 0.5 microg/mL for crude methanolic extract of
      Pseudocaryopteris foetida while ascorbic acid indicated total antioxidant
      capacity of 71.89 +/- 2.3 microg/mL. Study concluded that leaves of
      Pseudocaryopteris foetida were the rich source of antioxidant phytochemicals.
      Based on preliminary investigations further research should be focused to isolate
      bioactive phytochemicals as leading source of clinical medicines in future.

TI  - Upgrading the preparation of high-quality chitosan from Procambarus clarkii
      wastes over the traditional isolation of shrimp chitosan.
PG  - 911-919

AB  - Crustacean waste is one of the most severe issues, posing significant
      environmental and health risks. This study aims to improve managing marine waste 
      by isolating chitosan from Procambarus clarkii by devising a new methodology,
      incorporating technical steps, e.g., washing, decolorization and deacetylation
      under a reflexive condenser and dialysis purification. A comparison was made
      between the prepared P. clarkii chitosan and four types of shrimp chitosans:
      commercial, high, low, and nano. The obtained chitosan has a low molecular weight
      and viscosity compared to the commercial shrimp chitosan used in various
      applications. P. clarkii chitosan was prepared in high quality from a cheap
      source, as its color and quality were better than those of the commercial shrimp 
      chitosan. The new methodology has successfully extracted chitosan from P. clarkii
      in a good quality and high purity, achieving 89% deacetylation, high solubility, 
      high purity, and medium molecular weight. Analysis of the different chitosan
      samples with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), atomic force
      microscopy, Raman spectrum referred indicated high similarity between the
      chitosan different types, regardless of its source. The 3D image of P. clarkii
      showed the distance between the highest and most profound points of extracted
      chitosan is 728.94 nm, revealing homogeneous, smooth surfaces, apparently free of
      pores and cracks. FTIR and Raman spectrum of P. clarkii indicated various
      functional groups, e.g., alcohol, amines, amides, and phenols. These active
      groups are responsible for about 60% of the antioxidant activity of that product.
      Evaluating the quality traits indicated the excellence of the chitosan prepared
      from P. clarkii, especially in color, viscosity, and antioxidant activity,
      nominating it for different food applications.

TI  - Molecular characterization and expression profiling of transformer 2 and
      fruitless-like homologs in the black tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon.
PG  - e12980
LID - 10.7717/peerj.12980 [doi]
AB  - Transformer 2 (tra 2) and fruitless (fru) genes have been proven to play a key
      role in sex determination pathways in many Arthropods, including insects and
      crustaceans. In this study, a paralog of P. monodon tra 2 (Pmtra 2), P. monodon
      ovarian associated transformer 2 (PmOvtra 2) and 2 isoforms of P. monodon
      fruitless-like gene (Pmfru-1 and Pmfru-2) were identified and characterized. The 
      full cDNA sequence of PmOvtra 2 consisted of 1,774 bp with the longest open
      reading frame (ORF) of 744 bp encoding for 247 amino acids. The PmOvtra 2
      exhibited a predicted RNA-recognition motif (RRM) domain and two arginine-serine 
      (RS) regions, suggesting its function in RNA splicing. The full cDNA sequence of 
      Pmfru-1 consisted of 1,306 bp with 1,182 bp ORF encoding for 393 amino acids,
      whereas the full cDNA sequence of Pmfru-2 consisted of 1,858 bp with 1,437 bp ORF
      encoding 478 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequences of Pmfru-1 and Pmfru-2
      exhibited highly conserved domains of Fru proteins, including Broad-complex,
      Tramtrack and Bric-a-brac (BTB), and zinc finger (ZF) domains. In addition,
      Pmfru-1 and Pmfru-2 were suggestively originated from the same single genomic
      locus by genomic sequence analysis. Specifically, Pmfru pre-mRNA was
      alternatively spliced for Pmfru-1 and Pmfru-2 to include mutually exclusive exon 
      7 and exon 6, respectively. Temporal and spatial expression of PmOvtra 2,
      Pmfru-1, and Pmfru-2 were also investigated by qPCR. The results showed that all 
      were expressed in early developmental stages with undifferentiated gonads
      starting from nauplius until postlarvae. The expression of PmOvtra 2 started at
      nauplius stage and gradually increased from mysis to postlarvae (PL) 1. However, 
      the expression of Pmfru-1 was low at the nauplii stage and slightly increased
      from protozoea to PL5, whereas the expression of Pmfru-2 maintained a low level
      from nauplius to mysis and then gradually increased at the PL stages. Expressions
      of PmOvtra 2, Pmfru-1, and Pmfru-2 were detected in various tissues including
      nervous tissue, gill, heart, hepatopancreas, gut, and gonads. Interestingly, the 
      sexually dimorphic expression of PmOvtra 2, Pmfru-1, and Pmfru-2 was demonstrated
      in fully developed gonads in which the ovary showed significantly higher
      expressions than the testis. The great difference in the expression pattern of
      PmOvtra 2, Pmfru-1, and Pmfru-2 in the ovary and testis suggested their roles in 
      the female sex determination in P. monodon.

AB  - Experiments were conducted to evaluate the probiotic effect of bio-augmented
      Bacillus tequilensis AP BFT3 on improving production, immune response, and
      proteomic changes of Penaeus vannamei reared in a biofloc system. Penaeus
      vannamei larvae (PL13) were stocked in 100-L tanks at a rate of 100 no per tank
      to study the effect of B. tequilensis AP BFT3 with and without biofloc (BFT-PRO
      and PRO). Control tanks devoid of probiotic strain were maintained in a clear
      water system. The growth and survival considerably increased in probiotic added
      biofloc reared shrimp than probiotic added clear water reared ones and control.
      Water quality significantly improved in probiotic added (PRO) and
      biofloc-probiotics (BFT-PRO) system than control. Microbiological investigations 
      indicate increased heterotrophic bacterial load in BFT-PRO compared to the PRO
      and control. The quality of the isolated microbes was analyzed in terms of enzyme
      production, and an abundance of enzyme-producing bacterial population was
      observed in BFT-PRO shrimp. Immune-related genes were significantly upregulated
      in BFT-PRO shrimp, followed by the PRO and control. The proteomic data (2D gel
      electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF) of muscle tissue from the experimental animals
      identified 11 differentially expressed proteins. The Daxx OS and Lit v 1
      tropomyosin was found upregulated in BFT-PRO shrimps. Downregulation of
      Na(+)/K(+)ATPase was observed in biofloc with probiotic-supplied groups. The
      findings revealed that the BFT system's efficacy could be improved through the
      addition of probiotics. The addition of B. tequilensis AP BFT3 as a probiotic in 
      biofloc induced the expression of essential proteins, reducing contracting
      diseases during culture.

AB  - Type-I food allergies are hypersensitive reactions compromising the immune organs
      and epithelial barriers. To investigate the organ-specific proteomic alterations 
      of the allergy responses, the spleen and intestine of mice sensitized with high
      (shrimp and clam) and weak (fish) allergenic tropomyosins were analyzed using
      sequential windowed acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion mass spectra
      (SWATH-MS)-based proteomics. The results showed that Th1 and Th2
      tropomyosin-induced responses in the spleen are characterized by the unique
      upregulation of innate (cochlin) and adaptive (Ig kappa chain V-III region PC
      7175) immune regulators, respectively. In the intestine, tropomyosin allergy
      concurred with the downregulation of 35 differentiating proteins featuring the
      overall impairment of metabolic pathways, absorption processes and ammonium ion
      responses. These data provide new functional biomarkers of tropomyosin-induced
      immune responses as well as candidate targets for intervention.

AB  - Marine invertebrates inhabiting estuaries and coastal areas are exposed to
      natural suspended particulate matter (SPM) like clay or diatom shells but also to
      anthropogenic particles like microplastics. SPM concentrations may reach 1 g per 
      liter and more, comprising hundreds of millions of items in the size range of
      less than 100 mum. Suspension feeders and deposit feeders involuntarily ingest
      these particles along with their food. We investigated whether natural and
      anthropogenic microparticles at concentrations of 20 mg L(-1), which correspond
      to natural environmental SPM concentrations in coastal marine waters, are
      ingested by the brown shrimp Crangon crangon and whether these particles induce
      an oxidative stress response in digestive gland tissue. Shrimp were exposed to
      clay, silica, TiO2, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), or polylactide microplastics (PLA) 
      for 6, 12, 24, and 48 h, respectively. The activities of the anti-oxidative
      enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione
      reductase (GR) were measured. All five particle types were ingested by the shrimp
      along with food. The presence of the particles in the shrimp stomach was verified
      by scanning electron microscopy. The activities of the anti-oxidative enzymes did
      not vary between animals exposed to different types of microparticles and control
      animals that did not receive particles. The temporal activity differed between
      the three enzymes. The lack of a specific biochemical response may reflect an
      adaptation of C. crangon to life in an environment where frequent ingestion of
      non-digestible microparticles is unavoidable and continuous maintenance of
      inducible biochemical defense would be energetically costly. Habitat
      characteristics as well as natural feeding habits may be important factors to
      consider in the interpretation of hazard and species-specific risk assessment.

AB  - Polypropylene microplastic particles are one of the predominant pollutants in
      marine ecosystems and their toxic effects are unknown in aquatic biota. The study
      aims to prepare the spherical shaped polypropylene microplastics (size range
      11.86 mum-44.62 mum) and assess their toxic effects (1, 25, 50, 75 and 100
      mug/mL) in various life stages (nauplii, metanauplii and juvenile) of marine
      microcrustacean Artemia salina within 48 h. In addition, microplastics ingestion 
      by Artemia nauplii was proved by FTIR analysis. The results revealed,
      microplastics accumulation in their tract leads to change in their homeostasis,
      as followed increase in the oxidative burst causes mortality in nauplii (LC50
      40.947 mug/mL) and meta nauplii (LC50 51.954 mug/mL). In juvenile, swimming
      behaviour was changed. Moreover, microplastic consumption disturbs the
      antioxidant biomarkers such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT),
      reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione -S- Transferase (GST) and reduces the
      neurotransmitter enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. In addition,
      histology of juvenile Artemia showed damage in epithelial cells. This study
      indicates that exposure to polypropylene microplastics is more harmful to
      zooplanktonic organisms of the marine ecosystem.

TI  - The Omega-3 Index Response to an 8 Week Randomized Intervention Containing Three 
      Fatty Fish Meals Per Week Is Influenced by Adiposity in Overweight to Obese
      Women.
PG  - 810003
LID - 10.3389/fnut.2022.810003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) recommends consuming ~225 
      g/wk of a variety of seafood providing >1.75 g/wk of long-chain omega-3 fatty
      acids to reduce cardiovascular disease risk, however individual responses to
      treatment vary. OBJECTIVE: This study had three main objectives. First, to
      determine if a DGA-conforming diet (DGAD), in comparison to a typical American
      diet (TAD), can increase the omega-3 index (OM3I), i.e., the red blood cell mol% 
      of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Second, to identify 
      factors explaining variability in the OM3I response to dietary treatment. Third
      to identify factors associated with the baseline OM3I. DESIGN: This is a
      secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind 8 wk dietary intervention of
      overweight/obese women fed an 8d rotating TAD (n = 20) or DGAD (n = 22)
      registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02298725. The DGAD-group consumed 240 
      g/wk of Atlantic farmed salmon and albacore tuna in three meals with an estimated
      EPA + DHA of 3.7 +/- 0.6 g/wk. The TAD-group consumed ~160 g/wk of farmed white
      shrimp and a seafood salad containing imitation crab in three meal with an
      estimated EPA + DHA of 0.45 +/- 0.05 g/wk. Habitual diet was determined at
      baseline, and body composition was determined at 0 and 8wks. Red blood cell fatty
      acids were measured at 0, 2 and 8 wk. RESULTS: At 8 wk, the TAD-group OM3I was
      unchanged (5.90 +/- 1.35-5.80 +/- 0.76%), while the DGAD-group OM3I increased
      (5.63 +/- 1.27-7.33 +/- 1.36%; p < 0.001). In the DGAD-group 9 of 22 participants
      achieved an OM3I >8%. Together, body composition and the baseline OM3I explained 
      83% of the response to treatment variability. Baseline OM3I (5.8 +/- 1.3%; n =
      42) was negatively correlated to the android fat mass (p = 0.0007) and positively
      correlated to the FFQ estimated habitual (EPA+DHA) when expressed as a ratio to
      total dietary fat (p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: An 8 wk TAD did not change the OM3I
      of ~6%, while a DGAD with 240 g/wk of salmon and albacore tuna increased the
      OM3I. Body fat distribution and basal omega-3 status are primary factors
      influencing the OM3I response to dietary intake in overweight/obese women.

TI  - Association of Maternal Dietary Habits and MTHFD1 Gene Polymorphisms With
      Ventricular Septal Defects in Offspring: A Case-Control Study.
PG  - 785440
LID - 10.3389/fped.2021.785440 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed at assessing the association between maternal
      methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1 (MTHFD1) gene polymorphisms, maternal
      dietary habits, and their interactions with the risk of ventricular septal
      defects (VSD) in offspring. METHODS: From November 2017 to March 2019, a
      case-control study comprising 360 mothers of VSD cases and 504 mothers of healthy
      infants was conducted in Han Chinese populations. The main exposures of interest 
      were maternal dietary habits in early pregnancy and MTHFD1 gene polymorphisms.
      Logistic regression models were used to estimate the main effects and interaction
      effects. RESULTS: It was observed that maternal excessive intake of pickled
      vegetables (aOR = 1.85, 95%CI: 1.45-2.37), smoked foods (aOR = 1.93, 95%CI:
      1.48-2.51), barbecued foods (aOR = 1.74, 95%CI: 1.28-2.36), and fried foods (aOR 
      = 1.68, 95%CI: 1.30-2.17) were associated with a higher risk of VSD in offspring,
      whereas maternal excessive intake of fresh meat (aOR = 0.61, 95%CI: 0.47-0.79),
      fish and shrimp (aOR = 0.29, 95%CI: 0.23-0.38), fresh eggs (aOR = 0.54, 95%CI:
      0.42-0.70), fresh fruits or vegetables (aOR = 0.44, 95%CI: 0.33-0.60), soy foods 
      (aOR = 0.65, 95%CI: 0.53-0.80), and milk products (aOR = 0.49, 95%CI: 0.40-0.59) 
      could contribute significantly to a lower risk of VSD in offspring. Furthermore, 
      the genetic polymorphisms of maternal MTHFD1 gene at rs1950902 (GA vs. GG: aOR = 
      0.67, 95%CI: 0.50-0.90) and rs2236222 (GG vs. AA: aOR = 2.75, 95%CI: 1.57-4.83)
      were significantly associated with the risk of VSD in offspring. In addition,
      there was a significant interaction effect between maternal dietary habits and
      MTHFD1 gene polymorphisms on the risk of VSD. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal dietary
      factors, MTHFD1 genetic polymorphisms, and their interactions were all associated
      with the risk of VSD in offspring. However, further research in diverse ethnic
      populations and with a larger sample size is warranted to corroborate our

TI  - Detection of microplastics in Litopenaeus vannamei (Penaeidae) and Macrobrachium 
      rosenbergii (Palaemonidae) in cultured pond.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The presence of plastic particles in freshwater species is becoming a
      global concern owing to the potential impact on food security and human health.
      In this study, we investigated the presence microplastics (MPs) in two
      economically important freshwater species: the giant freshwater prawn
      (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) and the white leg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei)
      cultured in a polyculture pond in the central part of Thailand. METHODS: The
      gastrointestinal tract (GT) of 300 giant freshwater prawn (160 female and 140
      male) and 150 white leg shrimp specimens were investigated for the presence of
      MPs. RESULTS: From the pooled samples, a total of 1,166 MP items were identified.
      Specifically, the GTs of female and male freshwater prawns and white leg shrimps 
      contained an average of 33.31 +/- 19.42, 33.43 +/- 19.07, and 11.00 +/- 4.60 MP
      items per individual, respectively. Further, their mean MP contents per g of gut 
      material were 32.66 +/- 5.10, 32.14 +/- 4.85, and 10.28 +/- 1.19 MP items,
      respectively. In the GT of these species, MPs with sizes in the range 500-1000
      microm, were predominant, and white/transparent MPs were most prevalent (63.67%).
      Furthermore, regarding the morphotypes of the MPs, fibers, fragments, films, and 
      spheres were frequently observed, with fibers shows predominance. Specifically,
      the proportions of fibers in the GTs of female Macrobrachium rosenbergii, male
      Macrobrachium rosenbergii, and Litopenaeus vannamei were 83.3, 79.91, and 46.06%,
      respectively. Four MP polymer types, polyethylene, polycaprolactone, polyvinyl
      alcohol, and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, were also identified via FTIR
      spectroscopy, which further confirmed the presence of MPs in the GT of the
      freshwater-cultured species. DISCUSSION: Our findings indicated that consuming
      shrimps and prawns without first removing the MPs from their GTs is one of the
      mean by which humans get exposed to MPs. Thus, MPs in freshwater species can be
      passed down the food chain to humans.

TI  - First report on the occurrence of white spot syndrome virus, infectious
      myonecrosis virus and Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei in Penaeus vannamei reared in
      freshwater systems.
PG  - 699-706
LID - 10.1111/jfd.13595 [doi]
AB  - Samples of white leg shrimp, Penaeus vannamei, were collected on a monthly basis 
      from freshwater ponds with the salinity of 0 ppt located at Tiruvannamalai and
      Villupuram districts in Tamil Nadu, India for screening of viral and fungal
      pathogens. Totally, 130 shrimp samples were collected from 67 freshwater ponds
      and screened for white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), infectious myonecrosis virus
      (IMNV), infectious hypodermal and haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV) and
      Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP) by PCR and RT-PCR using pathogen-specific
      primers. Among the samples screened, one sample was found to be positive to WSSV,
      two samples showed positive to IMNV and two samples positive for EHP. No sample
      showed positive to IHHNV. The WSSV detected in the sample was found to be a new
      strain of WSSV and highly virulent. The inoculum prepared from freshwater reared 
      WSSV or IMNV-infected shrimp caused 100% mortality in experimental infection
      studies. The PCR and RT-PCR results revealed the presence of WSSV and IMNV in
      different organs of experimentally infected shrimp, respectively. No clinical
      signs were observed in experimentally EHP-injected shrimp, although the PCR
      results revealed the presence of EHP in experimentally infected shrimp.

TI  - Excess iron supplementation induced hepatopancreas lipolysis, destroyed
      intestinal function in Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei.

AB  - So far, the adverse effects of excess Fe in shrimp have been ignored for years as
      it was thought that extra Fe supplementation was not needed in the practical
      diets. Nowadays, Fe concentration in commercial shrimp feed from feed enterprises
      could be around 301.34-545.5 mg/kg, which is mainly due to the fish meal
      containing up to 1500 mg/kg Fe. Therefore, the purpose of this experiment was to 
      investigate the effects of Fe supplementation on the growth performance, tissue
      Fe deposition, hepatopancreas lipid metabolism, intestinal function in L.
      vannamei. The results showed that although growth performance was not influenced 
      by the dietary Fe supplementation, excess Fe supplementation (955.00 mg/kg)
      significantly increased hepatopancreas Fe deposition and induced lipolysis.
      Moreover, excess Fe supplementation impaired intestinal immune function and
      disrupted microbiota homeostasis. These findings might provide partial
      theoretical evidence for the effect of dietary Fe supplementation on
      physiological metabolism in L. vannamei.

AB  - Minced shrimp is popular seafood due to its delicious flavor and nutritional
      value. However, the biological species of raw material of minced shrimp are not
      distinguished by naked eyes after processing. Thus, an in situ and real-time
      minced shrimp authentication method was established using iKnife rapid
      evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS) based lipidomics. The samples
      were analyzed under ambient ionization without any tedious preparation step.
      Seven economic shrimp samples were tested, whose phenotypes were used to develop 
      a real-time recognition model. A total of 19 fatty acids and 45 phospholipid
      molecular species were efficiently identified and statistically analyzed by
      multivariate statistical analysis. The results showed that the seven shrimp
      species were well distinguished, and the most contributing ions at m/z 255.2,
      279.2, 301.2, 327.2, 699.5, 742.5, etc., were revealed by variable importance in 
      projection. The proposed iKnife REIMS showed excellent performance in minced
      shrimp authentication.

AB  - Loropetalum chinense var. rubrum is an ornamental shrub rich in polyphenolic
      compounds. In this study, polyphenolic compounds were extracted from L. chinense 
      var. rubrum petals (LCP) and further purified on macroporous resin column to
      afford two fractions. The crude extract of LCP (LCP-CE) and its two purified
      fractions (LCP-25PF and LCP-50PF) were individually incorporated into locust bean
      gum/polyvinyl alcohol matrix to develop smart packaging films. The structures,
      physical and functional properties of the films were compared. Results showed
      LCP-25PF was mainly composed of anthocyanins, while LCP-50PF was mainly composed 
      of chlorogenic acid and vanillin. LCP-CE, LCP-25PF and LCP-50PF interacted with
      locust bean gum/polyvinyl alcohol matrix through hydrogen bonds, thereby
      improving the light and oxygen barrier ability, tensile strength, thermal
      stability, antioxidant activity and antimicrobial activity of the film. The film 
      containing LCP-25PF showed the lowest water vapor permeability (10.36 x 10(-11) g
      m(-1) s(-1) Pa(-1)) and oxygen permeability (0.42 cm(3) mm m(-2) day(-1) atm(-1))
      but the highest tensile strength (29.76 MPa), antioxidant activity and
      antimicrobial activity. In addition, the films containing LCP-CE and LCP-25PF had
      pH-/ammonia-sensitivity and effectively indicated shrimp freshness at 4 degrees
      C. Results suggested the film containing LCP-25PF could be used as smart
      packaging film.

AB  - Trivalent arsenic (As (III)) contamination in the marine environment can produce 
      adverse effects in crustaceans. The present study investigated the chronic
      toxicity of As (III) in white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) by analyzing the tissue
      bioaccumulation and non-specific immune responses. Shrimps were exposed to 0
      (control), 50, 500, and 2500 mug/L of As (III) for 21 days. The results showed
      that the hepatopancreas was the main tissue of arsenic accumulation in white
      shrimp. The cumulative concentration of total arsenic and inorganic arsenic but
      not arsenobetaine was positively correlated with the exposure concentration. In
      vitro As (III) treatment (0-2500 mug/L) with haemocytes isolated from healthy
      shrimp did not cause the cytotoxicity, but this arsenic treatments inhibited the 
      phagocytic rate and O2(-) production. Moreover, the decrease of total haemocyte
      count and the inhibition of phagocytic rate, phagocytic index, O2(-) production
      and phenoloxidase activity were observed in white shrimp under the exposure of As
      (III) over a period of 21 days. This study revealed that chronic As (III) stress 
      could disturb arsenic metabolism and immune responses in P. vannamei.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) have been found in nearly half of the fish samples collected 
      from the field worldwide. There are feeding behavior differences caused by animal
      personality among fish individuals. However, how personality affects the exposure
      of fish to microplastics is unclear. In this study, adult zebrafish were used as 
      a model to study the effects of fish personality (boldness) on MPs exposure.
      Experiment showed that zebrafish captured MPs actively when MPs were added to the
      system but spit part of the MPs out after capturing. Bold zebrafish had higher
      feeding activities, captured MPs more frequently and swallowed more MPs than shy 
      zebrafish. Zebrafish ingested brine shrimp preferentially when both brine shrimp 
      and MPs were provided at the same time, and less MPs were swallowed in
      co-ingestion situation. Spearman correlation analysis indicated that there is a
      significantly positive correlation between boldness and feeding MPs frequency.
      Results of this work demonstrate that zebrafish mistake MPs as food and capture
      them actively but can discriminate MPs as inedible substances after ingestion and
      spit part of the MPs out. Bold zebrafish have a higher MP exposure burden than
      shy zebrafish due to their difference in feeding behaviors. The influence of fish
      personality needs to be considered for future toxicity studies and risk
      assessment of fish exposed to MPs.

AB  - Synthetic rubber emissions from automobile tires are common in aquatic
      ecosystems. To assess potential impacts on exposed organisms, early life stages
      of the estuarine indicator species Inland Silverside (Menidia beryllina) and
      mysid shrimp (Americamysis bahia) were exposed to three tire particle (TP)
      concentrations at micro and nano size fractions (0.0038, 0.0378 and 3.778 mg/L in
      mass concentrations for micro size particles), and separately to leachate, across
      a 5-25 PSU salinity gradient. Following exposure, M. beryllina and A. bahia had
      significantly altered swimming behaviors, such as increased freezing, changes in 
      positioning, and total distance moved, which could lead to an increased risk of
      predation and foraging challenges in the wild. Growth for both A. bahia and M.
      beryllina was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner when exposed to
      micro-TP, whereas M. beryllina also demonstrated reduced growth when exposed to
      nano-TP (except lowest concentration). TP internalization was dependent on the
      exposure salinity in both taxa. The presence of adverse effects in M. beryllina
      and A. bahia indicate that even at current environmental levels of tire-related
      pollution, which are expected to continue to increase, aquatic ecosystems may be 
      experiencing negative impacts.

LID - 10.1111/jfd.13594 [doi]
AB  - DNAzymes have been widely and effectively used for the detection of pathogenic
      bacteria, which pose a serious public health threat. However, the rapid and
      cost-effective detection of such bacteria remains a major challenge. In this
      study, we successfully selected Vibrio alginolyticus-specific DNAzymes. The
      activity of the candidates was assessed via fluorescence intensity and gel
      electrophoresis. The DNAzyme DT1 had a detection limit of 31 CFU/ml for V.
      alginolyticus and exhibited high specificity. Graphene oxide (GO) was used to
      develop a DNAzyme-based fluorescent sensor for the detection of V. alginolyticus,
      which significantly improved detection performance and shortened the reaction
      time as little as 10 s. The proposed method was then validated using crab,
      shrimp, fish, clam, and oyster samples. This study thus provides a new method for
      the rapid and sensitive detection of V. alginolyticus.

TI  - Effects of the Probiotic Psychrobacter sp. B6 on the Growth, Digestive Enzymes,
      Antioxidant Capacity, Immunity, and Resistance of Exopalaemon carinicauda to
      Aeromonas hydrophila.

AB  - Probiotics, known to improve the water quality and the host's intestinal
      microbial balance, has gained more and more attention in recent years. The
      effects of Psychrobacter sp. B6 on the growth and immunity of Exopalaemon
      carinicauda were investigated in this study. Psychrobacter sp. B6 was sprayed to 
      the basal diet with four different levels (0 [basal diet], 5 x 10(5), 5 x 10(7), 
      and 5 x 10(9) CFU/100 g diet) and were fed to E. carinicauda (average weight 1.15
      +/- 0.04 g) for 30 days. At the end of the feeding trial, shrimps were immersed
      in seawater contaminated with 10(6) CFU/mL pathogenic Aeromonas hydrophila for 2 
      h and then the cumulative mortality was calculated after 14 days observation. The
      results showed that the weight gain rate, survival rate, and specific growth rate
      of E. carinicauda were significantly increased with the increasing dietary level 
      of Psychrobacter sp. B6. The activities of digestive enzymes (alpha-amylase and
      chymotrypsin) were significantly increased (P < 0.05) in the groups fed with
      Psychrobacter sp. B6, and the highest activities of digestive enzymes were
      detected in the 5 x 10(9) CFU/100 g diet group. The activities of antioxidant
      enzymes (catalase, peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase) in probiotics treated
      shrimp were significantly higher than those in the control shrimp, with the
      highest activity in 5 x 10(9) and 5 x 10(7) CFU/100 g diet group separately. At
      the same time, the activities of immune-related enzymes (alkaline phosphatase and
      lysozyme) were significantly affected by the dietary B6 content, and the highest 
      activity of immune-related enzymes was found in shrimps fed with 5 x 10(7)
      CFU/100 g diet. The relative expression levels of CTL (C-type lectin), MBL
      (mannose-binding lectin), SPI (serine protease inhibitor), and ProPo
      (prophenoloxidase) in hepatopancreas of E. carinicauda with 5 x 10(9) CFU/100 g
      diet were significantly higher than those in the control. Moreover, cumulative
      mortality (22.22%) post-challenge with A. hydrophila was the lowest in 5 x 10(9) 
      CFU/100 g diet. The results suggested that Psychrobacter sp. B6 could effectively
      promote the growth, immunity, antioxidant capacity, and disease resistance of E. 
      carinicauda. This study provided a reference for the study on the artificial
      breeding of E. carinicauda.

AB  - The Toll signaling pathway plays an important role in animal innate immunity.
      However, its activation and signal transmission greatly differ across species and
      need to be investigated. Shrimp farming is a worldwide economic activity affected
      by bacterial disease from the 1990s, which promoted research on shrimp immunity. 
      In this study, we first proved that, among the three identified Toll receptors in
      Marsupenaeus japonicus kuruma shrimp, Toll 3 plays a pivotal role in initiating
      the antibacterial response in vivo, especially upon anti-Staphylococcus aureus
      infection. Further research showed that this result was due to the activation of 
      the Dorsal transcription factor, which induced the expression of two
      anti-lipopolysaccharide factors (Alfs). Moreover, the evolutionarily conserved
      signaling intermediate in Toll pathways, ECSIT, was proved to be needed for
      signal transmission from Toll 3 to Dorsal and the expression of
      anti-lipopolysaccharide factors. Finally, the mortality assay showed that a
      Toll3-ECSIT-Dorsal-Alf axis was functional in the anti-S.aureus immunity of M.
      japonicus shrimp. The results provide new insights into the function and signal
      transduction of the Toll pathway in aquatic species and offer basic knowledge for
      shrimp disease control and genetic breeding.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a lack of data on seafood-induced anaphylaxis in children in
      Canada. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the rate, clinical features, and management of
      seafood-induced anaphylaxis in children presenting to emergency departments
      across Canada. METHODS: Children with anaphylaxis were recruited at 6 emergency
      departments between 2011 and 2020 as part of the Cross-Canada Anaphylaxis
      REgistry. A standardized form documenting symptoms, triggers, comorbidities, and 
      management was used to collect data. RESULTS: There were 75 fish-induced and 71
      shellfish-induced cases of suspected anaphylaxis, most of which were caused by
      salmon and shrimp, respectively. Mucocutaneous symptoms were most common, whereas
      respiratory symptoms were associated with patients with fish-induced reactions
      who have comorbid asthma (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.18; 95% confidence
      interval [CI], 1.02-1.36). Prehospital epinephrine was underused (<35%), whereas 
      in-hospital epinephrine was given to less than 60% of the patients. Among those
      with a known fish or shellfish allergy, prehospital epinephrine use was
      associated with known asthma (aOR 1.39 [95% CI, 1.05-1.84] and aOR 1.25 [95% CI, 
      1.02-1.54], respectively). Among children who were assessed by either skin test
      or specific immunoglobulin E, 36 patients (76.6%) with suspected fish-induced
      anaphylaxis and 19 patients (51.4%) with suspected shellfish-induced anaphylaxis 
      tested positive. CONCLUSION: Prehospital epinephrine is underused in the
      management of seafood-induced anaphylaxis. Among children with known seafood
      allergy, prehospital epinephrine use is more likely if there is a known asthma
      comorbidity.

TI  - Comparative genome analyses of five Vibrio penaeicida strains provide insights
      into their virulence-related factors.
LID - 10.1099/mgen.0.000766 [doi]
AB  - Vibrio penaeicida (family Vibrionaceae) is an important bacterial pathogen that
      affects Japanese shrimp aquaculture. Only two whole-genome sequences of V.
      penaeicida are publicly available, which has hampered our understanding of the
      pathogenesis of shrimp vibriosis caused by this bacterium. To gain insight into
      the genetic features, evolution and pathogenicity of V. penaeicida, we sequenced 
      five V. penaeicida strains (IFO 15640(T), IFO 15641, IFO 15642, TUMSAT-OK1 and
      TUMSAT-OK2) and performed comparative genomic analyses. Virulence factors and
      mobile genetic elements were detected. Furthermore, average nucleotide identities
      (ANIs), clusters of orthologous groups and phylogenetic relationships were
      evaluated. The V. penaeicida genome consists of two circular chromosomes.
      Chromosome I sizes ranged from 4.1 to 4.3 Mb, the GC content ranged from 43.9 to 
      44.1 %, and the number of predicted protein-coding sequences (CDSs) ranged from
      3620 to 3782. Chromosome II sizes ranged from 2.2 to 2.4 Mb, the GC content
      ranged from 43.5 to 43.8 %, and the number of predicted CDSs ranged from 1992 to 
      2273. All strains except IFO 15641 harboured one plasmid, having sizes that
      ranged from 150 to 285 kb. All five genomes had typical virulence factors,
      including adherence, anti-phagocytosis, flagella-related proteins and toxins
      (repeats-in-toxin and thermolabile haemolysin). The genomes also contained
      factors responsible for iron uptake and the type II, IV and VI secretion systems.
      The genome of strain TUMSAT-OK2 tended to encode more prophage regions than the
      other strains, whereas the genome of strain IFO 15640(T) had the highest number
      of regions encoding genomic islands. For comparative genome analysis, we used V. 
      penaeicida (strain CAIM 285(T)) as a reference strain. ANIs between strain CAIM
      285(T) and the five V. penaeicida strains were >95 %, which indicated that these 
      strains belong to the same species. Orthology cluster analysis showed that
      strains TUMSAT-OK1 and TUMSAT-OK2 had the greatest number of shared gene
      clusters, followed by strains CAIM 285(T) and IFO 15640(T). These strains were
      also the most closely related to each other in a phylogenetic analysis. This
      study presents the first comparative genome analysis of V. penaeicida and these
      results will be useful for understanding the pathogenesis of this bacterium.

AB  - Bauhinia variegata plant is a very popular and traditionally potent
      ethnomedicine. Therefore, it is need of hour to study ameliorative
      characteristics of B. variegata for novel secondary metabolites. The current
      study was designed to explore antiproliferative potential of B. variegata due to 
      scant reports on this aspect. Extracts of various parts (flowers, leaves, bark,
      stem, and roots) were prepared by successive maceration using organic solvents in
      increasing order of polarity (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, methanol, and water). The 
      determination of polyphenolic contents was done by using colorimetric methods
      while antioxidant potential was measured using reducing power assay. Brine shrimp
      lethality assay was performed for determining preliminary cytotoxicity and
      antiproliferative activity against breast cancer MCF-7 cell line using MTT
      protocols. Moreover, antimicrobial activities were detected by using disc
      diffusion assay. The alpha-amylase assay was performed to monitor the
      antidiabetic potential of the plant. In case of phytochemical analysis methanolic
      extract of leaves and bark showed highest phenolic and flavonoids contents.
      n-Hexane and ethyl acetate extracts of stem and roots exhibited more than 90%
      mortality with LD50 ranges between 1-25 microg/mL when studied by brine shrimp
      lethality assay. n-Hexane and ethyl acetate extracts of roots and stem also
      showed antiproliferative activity against human breast cancer MCF-7 cell line
      with IC50 values ranges between 12.10-14.20 microg/mL. Most of the extracts
      displayed moderately high antibacterial and antifungal activities. The n-hexane
      extract of roots showed antidiabetic activity with 60.80 +/- 0.20% inhibition of 
      alpha-amylase. In sum, these preliminary results will be useful for further
      compound isolation from selected plant parts for the discovery of antibacterial, 
      antidiabetic, and anticancer lead candidates.

TI  - A Suite of TMPRSS2 Assays for Screening Drug Repurposing Candidates as Potential 
      Treatments of COVID-19.

LID - 10.1101/2022.02.04.479134 [doi]
AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is the causative viral pathogen driving the COVID-19 pandemic that
      prompted an immediate global response to the development of vaccines and
      antiviral therapeutics. For antiviral therapeutics, drug repurposing allowed for 
      rapid movement of existing clinical candidates and therapies into human clinical 
      trials to be tested as COVID-19 therapies. One effective antiviral treatment
      strategy used early in symptom onset is to prevent viral entry. SARS-CoV-2 enters
      ACE2-expressing cells when the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein on
      the surface of SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 followed by cleavage at two cut sites on 
      the spike protein. TMPRSS2 has a protease domain capable of cleaving the two cut 
      sites; therefore, a molecule capable of inhibiting the protease activity of
      TMPRSS2 could be a valuable antiviral therapy. Initially, we used a fluorogenic
      high-throughput screening assay for the biochemical screening of 6030 compounds
      in NCATS annotated libraries. Then, we developed an orthogonal biochemical assay 
      that uses mass spectrometry detection of product formation to ensure that hits
      from the primary screen are not assay artifacts from the fluorescent detection of
      product formation. Finally, we assessed the hits from the biochemical screening
      in a cell-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped particle entry assay. Of the six molecules
      advanced for further studies, two are approved drugs in Japan (camostat and
      nafamostat), two have entered clinical trials (PCI-27483 and otamixaban), while
      the other two molecules are peptidomimetic inhibitors of TMPRSS2 taken from the
      literature that have not advanced into clinical trials (compounds 92 and 114).
      This work demonstrates a suite of assays for the discovery and development of new
      inhibitors of TMPRSS2.

TI  - Antioxidant Potential and Enhancement of Bioactive Metabolite Production in In
      Vitro Cultures of Scutellaria lateriflora L. by Biotechnological Methods.
LID - 1140 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27031140 [doi]
AB  - Studies carried out using three different in vitro assays and a biological
      setting (Escherichia coil) demonstrated the antioxidant activity of Scutellaria
      lateriflora microshoot extract. Moreover, the extract exhibited no toxicity in a 
      brine shrimp lethality bioassay. These results indicated that microshoots are a
      rich, safe source of antioxidants, which encouraged us to enhance their
      production in vitro. In agar and agitated cultures, two biotechnological
      strategies were applied: feeding the cultures with the biogenetic precursors of
      the phenolics-phenylalanine and tyrosine, and eliciting them with methyl
      jasmonate. Specific Scutellaria flavonoids and verbascoside were analysed by
      HPLC. Feeding with precursors (1 g/L) in agar cultures decreased the production
      of the metabolites. In agitated cultures, different concentrations of precursors 
      (1.0-2.5 g/L) and the elicitor (10; 50; 100 microM) were tested. Additionally,
      parallel feeding with the precursor and elicitor in a concentration of 50 microM 
      were applied. The best strategy for total flavonoid and verbascoside production
      was phenylalanine feeding (1.5 g/L), max. 3765 and 475 mg/100 g DW, respectively,
      after 7 days. This is the first report documenting the high antioxidant
      production in S. lateriflora microshoots after feeding with phenylalanine.
      Moreover, for the first time, bioreactor cultures were successfully maintained,
      obtaining attractive results (max. total flavonoid content 2348 and verbascoside 
      485 mg/100 g DW).

TI  - Genome-Wide Analysis Indicates a Complete Prostaglandin Pathway from Synthesis to
      Inactivation in Pacific White Shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei.
LID - 1654 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23031654 [doi]
AB  - Prostaglandins (PGs) play many essential roles in the development, immunity,
      metabolism, and reproduction of animals. In vertebrates, arachidonic acid (ARA)
      is generally converted to prostaglandin G2 (PGG2) and H2 (PGH2) by cyclooxygenase
      (COX); then, various biologically active PGs are produced through different
      downstream prostaglandin synthases (PGSs), while PGs are inactivated by
      15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (PGDH). However, there is very limited
      knowledge of the PG biochemical pathways in invertebrates, particularly for
      crustaceans. In this study, nine genes involved in the prostaglandin pathway,
      including a COX, seven PGSs (PGES, PGES2, PGDS1/2, PGFS, AKR1C3, and TXA2S), and 
      a PGDH were identified based on the Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei)
      genome, indicating a more complete PG pathway from synthesis to inactivation in
      crustaceans than in insects and mollusks. The homologous genes are conserved in
      amino acid sequences and structural domains, similar to those of related species.
      The expression patterns of these genes were further analyzed in a variety of
      tissues and developmental processes by RNA sequencing and quantitative real-time 
      PCR. The mRNA expression of PGES was relatively stable in various tissues, while 
      other genes were specifically expressed in distant tissues. During embryo
      development to post-larvae, COX, PGDS1, GDS2, and AKR1C3 expressions increased
      significantly, and increasing trends were also observed on PGES, PGDS2, and
      AKR1C3 at the post-molting stage. During the ovarian maturation, decreasing
      trends were found on PGES1, PGDS2, and PGDH in the hepatopancreas, but all gene
      expressions remained relatively stable in ovaries. In conclusion, this study
      provides basic knowledge for the synthesis and inactivation pathway of PG in
      crustaceans, which may contribute to the understanding of their regulatory
      mechanism in ontogenetic development and reproduction.

TI  - Hydrosols from Rosmarinus officinalis, Salvia officinalis, and Cupressus
      sempervirens: Phytochemical Analysis and Bioactivity Evaluation.
LID - 349 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/plants11030349 [doi]
AB  - The present work evaluates the aromatic waters of rosemary (Salvia rosmarinus
      Spenn. syn. Rosmarinus officinalis L.), sage (Salvia officinalis L.), and cypress
      (Cupressus sempervirens L.) obtained as innovative commercial products of a
      hydrodistillation process. All extracts were exhaustively analysed by GC-MS,
      (1)H-NMR, and LC-MS in order to evaluate potential metabolite fingerprint
      differences. GC-MS appears to be the most exhaustive technique for the
      qualitative identification of the single constituents, although in this case, the
      use of (1)H-NMR and LC-MS techniques allowed some useful considerations in
      semi-quantitative terms. Antimycotic effects were studied against Tricophyton,
      Candida, and Arthroderma species, resulting in weak activity. The toxicological
      impact was partly evaluated in vitro by means of allelopathy and brine shrimp
      lethality. Cytotoxicity was investigated in human colon cancer cells (HCT116) and
      in hypothalamic cells (Hypo-E22) challenged with hydrogen peroxide. Sage and
      rosemary hydrosols were the most effective antimycotics, whereas all hydrosols
      displayed antiradical effects. Cytotoxic effects against HCT116 cells (at 500
      microL/mL) were related in silico to the endovanilloid TRPM8 and TRPV1 receptors.
      At lower concentrations (5-50 microL/mL), the hydrosols protected hypothalamic
      neurons Hypo-E22 cells from hydrogen peroxide-induced toxicity. The overall
      experience indicates that hydrolates are an important source of relevant
      phytochemicals with significant pharmacological potential.

TI  - Adsorption of Cu (II) Ions Present in the Distilled Beverage (Sugar Cane Spirit) 
      Using Chitosan Derived from the Shrimp Shell.
LID - 573 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/polym14030573 [doi]
AB  - Cachaca (sugar cane spirit) is a typically Brazilian distilled beverage. Copper
      ions can be present in craft beverages despite their acceptance in the national
      and international market. This study aims to evaluate the efficiency of chitosan 
      as an adsorbent in removing copper (II) from cachaca. The structural
      characteristics of the obtained chitosan and the effect of adsorbed copper were
      evaluated by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), viscosimetry,
      X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The
      deacetylation reaction from chitin (shrimp shell) resulted in chitosan with a
      deacetylation degree of 88.9% (potentiometric titration) and 86.9% (FTIR), low
      crystallinity, and an estimated molecular weight of 162.96 kDa. The copper
      reduction rate was 84.09% evaluated by spectrophotometric titration and
      microwave-induced plasma optical emission spectrometry (MIP-OES). The amine
      groups of chitosan had adsorption affinity with copper ions, and the kinetic
      analysis showed a better fit of the data by the Elovich equation, suggesting that
      the chemosorption mechanism controlled the kinetic process. The results suggest
      that chitosan has the potential to improve the quality and safety of cachaca.

TI  - Partially Deacetylated and Fibrillated Shrimp Waste-Derived Chitin as Biopolymer 
      Emulsifier for Green Cutting Fluids-Towards a Cleaner Production.
LID - 525 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/polym14030525 [doi]
AB  - Up to date, most metalworking fluids (MWFs) are emulsions made of
      petroleum-derived oil bases and sodium petroleum sulphonate emulsifiers. They are
      not readily biodegradable, and their waste is hazardous for users and the
      environment. Therefore, green MWFs are required for achieving cleaner production 
      processes. Recently, various MWFs have been developed using vegetable oil bases
      to meet biodegradability to some extent. However, the emulsifier has been
      scarcely replaced by a green product. This research aims to produce and evaluate 
      Pickering emulsions made of Jatropha oil (JO) and partially deacetylated and
      fibrillated chitin (PDFC) as emulsifiers at different concentrations. JO is a
      non-edible biodegradable oil with remarkable lubricity properties, while PDFC is 
      produced by extracting chitin from waste heads and shells of the shrimp species
      Litopenaeus vannameii, followed by partial deacetylation and further
      fibrillation, which improves wettability and stabilization. The prepared
      emulsions were characterized in terms of creaming index and size of emulsion
      droplets and evaluated as MWFs in actual turning operations of AISI 1018 steel
      bars via minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) technique. The findings suggest PDFC 
      as a potential eco-friendly emulsifier to form green MWFs with acceptable
      stability generating low cutting forces and significant workpiece finishing and
      chips quality.

TI  - Intensification of Penaeid Shrimp Culture: An Applied Review of Advances in
      Production Systems, Nutrition and Breeding.
LID - 236 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12030236 [doi]
AB  - Intensification of the shrimp sector, also referred to as vertical expansion, has
      been predominately driven by consecutive incidences of global disease outbreaks, 
      which have caused enormous economic loss for the main producer countries. A
      growing segment of the shrimp farming industry has opted to use production
      systems with higher density, biosecurity, and operating control to mitigate the
      risks posed by disease. However, successful super-intensive shrimp production is 
      reliant on an advanced understanding of many important biological and economic
      parameters in the farming system, coupled with effective monitoring, to maintain 
      optimal production. Compared to traditional extensive or semi-intensive systems, 
      super-intensive systems require higher inputs of feed, energy, labor, and
      supplements. These systems are highly sensitive to the interactions between these
      different inputs and require that the biological and economical parameters of
      farming are carefully balanced to ensure success. Advancing nutritional knowledge
      and tools to support consistent and efficient production of shrimp in these
      high-cost super-intensive systems is also necessary. Breeding programs developing
      breeding-lines selected for these challenging super-intensive environments are
      critical. Understanding synergies between the key areas of production systems,
      nutrition, and breeding are crucial for super-intensive farming as all three
      areas coalesce to influence the health of shrimp and commercial farming success. 
      This article reviews current strategies and innovations being used for
      Litopenaeus vannamei in production systems, nutrition, and breeding, and
      discusses the synergies across these areas that can support the production of
      healthy and high-quality shrimp in super-intensive systems. Finally, we briefly
      discuss some key issues of social license pertinent to the super-intensive shrimp
      farming industry.

AB  - For commercial aquatic animals, hypoxia phenomenon often occurs in live transport
      and aquaculture. In previous studies, much interest has been focused on
      antioxidant enzyme activities and could not present the complexities. The
      multifaceted responses, especially considering physiological indexes,
      histological structure, cell apoptosis, and immune pathways, are still unknown.
      In this study, we investigated the comprehensive hypoxic responses of
      Marsupenaeus japonicus. The results showed that the physiological indexes showed 
      time-dependent changes upon hypoxia stress. Hypoxia stress led to significant
      tissue damage and cell apoptosis in the gill and hepatopancreas. Compared with
      the control group, the apoptosis index (AI) of the 12 h hypoxic treatment
      increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the gills and hepatopancreas. Comparative
      transcriptome analysis identified 900 and 1400 differentially expressed genes
      (DEGs) in the gill and hepatopancreas, respectively. Several DEGs were related to
      the lysosome, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, citrate cycle, and apoptosis, and seven
      of them were validated using quantitative real-time PCR. This study provided
      valuable clues to understanding the mechanisms underlying the hypoxic responses
      of M. japonicus.

AB  - Nanoplastic, ubiquitous in aquatic environments, are raising concern worldwide.
      However, studies on nanoplastic exposure and its effects on ion transport in
      aquatic organisms are limited. In this study, the juvenile oriental river shrimp,
      Macrobrachium nipponense, was exposed to five levels of nanoplastic
      concentrations (0, 5, 10, 20, 40 mg/L) in order to evaluate cell viability, ion
      content, ion transport, ATPase activity, and related gene expression. The results
      showed that the apoptosis rate was higher in the high concentration nanoplastic
      group (40 mg/L) compared to the low concentration nanoplastic group (5 mg/L) and 
      the control group (0 mg/L). The ion content of sodium (Na(+)), potassium (K(+)), 
      chloride (Cl(-)), and calcium (Ca(2+)) showed a decreasing trend in gill tissue
      compared to the control group. The Na(+)K(+)-ATPase, V(H)-ATPase,
      Ca(2+)Mg(2+)-ATPase, and total ATPase activities in the gills of M. nipponense
      showed a general decrease with the increasement of nanoplastic concentration and 
      time of exposure. When increasing nanoplastic concentration, the expression of
      ion transport-related genes in the gills of M. nipponense showed first rise then 
      descend trend. As elucidated by the results, high nanoplastic concentrations have
      negative effect on cell viability, ion content, ion transport ATPase activity,
      and ion transport-related gene expression in the gills of M. nipponense. This
      research provides a theoretical foundation for the toxic effects of nanoplastic
      in aquaculture.

TI  - Comparative Toxicity of Oil Spill Herding Agents to Aquatic Species.
PG  - 1311-1318
LID - 10.1002/etc.5310 [doi]
AB  - Chemical herding agents are surfactant mixtures used to coalesce spilled oil and 
      increase slick thickness to facilitate mechanical recovery or in situ burning.
      Only two herders are currently listed on the United States' National Oil and
      Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan or National Contingency Plan
      product schedule for potential use in spill response: the surface collecting
      agents Siltech OP-40 and ThickSlick 6535. Toxicity data for spill response agents
      are frequently available only for two estuarine species, mysid shrimp
      (Americamysis bahia) and inland silversides (Menidia beryllina), and are
      particularly limited for herding agents. Toxicity can vary over several orders of
      magnitude across product type and species, even within specific categories of
      spill response agents. Seven aquatic species were tested with both Siltech OP-40 
      and ThickSlick 6535 to evaluate acute herder toxicity and relative species
      sensitivity. The toxicity assessment included: acute tests with A. bahia and M.
      beryllina, the freshwater crustacean Ceriodaphina dubia, and the freshwater fish 
      Pimephales promelas; development of the echinoderm Arbacia unctulate; and growth 
      of a freshwater alga Raphidocelis subcapitata and marine alga Dunaliella
      tertiolecta. Siltech acute toxicity values ranged from 1.1 to 32.8 ppm.
      ThickSlick acute toxicity values ranged from 2.2 to 126.4 ppm. The results of
      present study show greater toxicity of Siltech compared to ThickSlick with
      estimated acute hazard concentrations intended to provide 95% species protection 
      of 1.1 and 3.6 ppm, respectively, on empirical data and 0.64 and 3.3 ppm,
      respectively, with the addition of interspecies correlation data. The present
      study provides a greater understanding of species sensitivity of these two oil
      spill response agents. Environ Toxicol Chem 2022;41:1311-1318. (c) 2022 SETAC.

TI  - Direct and indirect effects of amphidromous shrimps on nutrient mineralization in
      streams in Japan.
PG  - 493-505
LID - 10.1007/s00442-022-05119-6 [doi]
AB  - Animals affect element cycling in ecosystems by consumption and excretion.
      Amphidromous shrimps frequently dominate low-mid altitude streams, where
      downstream connectivity to oceans is sustained. Although shrimps' direct
      influence on benthic communities has been studied, little is known about their
      influences on nutrient cycling. Here, we hypothesized that the dominance of
      shrimps alters nutrient mineralization by benthic macroinvertebrates in streams
      due to the difference in the quality and quantity of excretion between shrimps
      and aquatic insects. We tested this hypothesis through a field manipulative
      experiment, excretion measurements of animals, and field surveys. In the field
      manipulative experiment, the presence of shrimps slightly decreased the biomass
      of aquatic insects but tripled total benthic macroinvertebrate biomass directly
      through their own biomass. The mass-specific NH4(+) excretion rate by shrimps was
      similar to aquatic insects, and the areal NH4(+) excretion by benthic
      macroinvertebrates was increased by 2.5 times in the presence of shrimps. In
      contrast, shrimps excreted significantly less soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP)
      than aquatic insects, and the presence of shrimps did not affect areal SRP
      excretion by benthic macroinvertebrates. The field survey showed a positive
      correlation of NO3(-) concentration with the shrimp density, inferring the excess
      NH4(+) was nitrified. Although the nutrient concentration of stream water is
      frequently attributed to watershed conditions, the results of this study indicate
      that downstream connectivity to oceans may also influence nutrient dynamics of
      the stream through the density of amphidromous shrimps.

AB  - Shrimp allergen, tropomyosin is a highly heat stable allergen a common causative 
      of shrimp allergy in sensitive individuals. Effect of house hold pressure cooking
      on immunogenicity of shrimp allergen, topomyosin from Metapenaeus dobsoni was
      investigated in both shrimp extract and peeled shrimp by extending the time of
      pressure cooking to 5, 10 and 20 min. Soaked shrimps in salt, baking soda, papain
      and acetic acid along with pressure cooking was also investigated. In the case of
      extracts, IgE activity was significantly (p < 0.05) decreased and the tropomyosin
      band was absent in the immunoblott using pooled sera of shrimp sensitive
      individuals. While in the case of whole peeled shrimp, IgE activity was
      significantly (p < 0.05) increased and the tropomyosin band was retained in the
      immunoblott analysis which indicates the retention of allerginicity in the peeled
      shrimp. Although pressure cooked shrimp after soaking in acetic acid didn't show 
      significant (p > 0.05) difference to that of without soaking, the tropomyosin
      band was observed to be very faint or absent in SDS PAGE and immunoblott analysis
      which indicated the effective reduction in allegenicity of whole peeled shrimp.

      treated because of the related complications caused by migratory pharyngeal
      foreign bodies from 2012 to 2020. RESULTS: A total of 20 patients were admitted
      to hospital due to the related complications. 14 cases showed cervical mass; 3
      cases showed abscess of the mouth floor; 1 cases showed retropharyngeal abscess; 
      1 cases showed laryngeal granuloma; 1 cases showed mass of tongue. All patients
      received imaging examination of B-ultrasonography or computed tomography (CT). 19
      patients were treated by surgery, and 1 patient was taken conservative treatment.
      All foreign bodies was successfully removed. As for the type of foreign bodies,
      there have 15 cases of fishbone, 2 cases of crabshell, 2 cases of shrimp shell, 1
      cases of duck bone. CONCLUSIONS: Migrating foreign bodies and related
      complications are rare in clinic, much attention should be paid to avoid missed
      diagnosis or misdiagnosis.

AB  - Methyl farnesoate (MF) is an essential endocrine hormone in crustaceans, which
      can promote the occurrence of crustaceans molting, control morphogenesis, affect 
      gonad development, and regulate the stress stimulation to the external
      environment. The farnesoic acid O-methyltransferase (FAMeT) is a key
      rate-limiting enzyme in MF synthesis, catalyzing the conversion of farnesoic acid
      (FA) into MF. Neocaridina denticulata sinensis [Decapoda] is a suitable animal
      model for studying crustaceans because it can reproduce many times under
      artificial control and has a short reproductive cycle. According to its
      transcriptomic and genomic information, the full-length cDNA sequence of FAMeT
      from N. denticulata sinensis (NdFAMeT) was cloned and the characterization of its
      deduced amino acid sequence was also analyzed. The relative expression of NdFAMeT
      in different tissues was determined. The NdFAMeT protein was recombinantly
      expressed in E. coli and its enzyme activity was determined. After gene knockdown
      by RNAi technology, the protein activity of shrimp was decreased and the
      individual phenotype was also observed.

TI  - Shrimp Plasma MANF Works as an Invertebrate Anti-Inflammatory Factor via a
      Conserved Receptor Tyrosine Phosphatase.
PG  - 1214-1223
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.2100595 [doi]
AB  - For a long time, how anti-inflammatory factors evolved was largely unknown. In
      this study, we chose a marine invertebrate, Litopenaeus vannamei, as a model and 
      identified that shrimp mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF)
      was an LPS-induced plasma protein, which exerted its anti-inflammatory roles on
      shrimp hemocytes by suppressing ERK phosphorylation and Dorsal expression. In
      addition, we demonstrated that shrimp MANF could be associated with a receptor
      protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) to mediate negative regulation of ERK
      activation and Dorsal expression. More interestingly, shrimp RPTP-S
      overexpression in 293T cells could switch shrimp and human MANF-mediated ERK
      pathway activation to inhibition. In general, our results indicate that this
      conserved RPTP is the key component for extracellular MANF-mediated ERK pathway
      inhibition, which gives a possible explanation about why this neurotropic factor 
      could both protect neuron cells from apoptosis and inhibit immune cell M1
      activation in various species.

TI  - Cross-processing herring and salmon co-products with agricultural and marine
      side-streams or seaweeds produces protein isolates more stable towards lipid
      oxidation.

AB  - Herring and salmon filleting co-products were pH-shift processed together with
      seven antioxidant-containing raw materials ("helpers") including lingonberry-,
      apple-, oat-, barley- and shrimp-co-products, and two seaweeds (Saccharina
      latissima, Ulva fenestrata) to produce protein isolates stable towards lipid
      oxidation. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxy-(E)-2-hexenal (HHE) levels
      revealed that all helpers, except shrimp shells, to different extents retarded
      lipid oxidation both during pH-shift-processing and ice storage. The three
      helpers performing best were: lingonberry press-cake > apple pomace approximately
      Ulva. Color of protein isolates was affected by helper-derived pigments (e.g.,
      anthocyanins, carotenoids, chlorophyll) and lipid oxidation-induced changes
      (e.g., metHb-formation, pigment-bleaching). In conclusion, combining fish
      co-products with other food side-streams or seaweeds during pH-shift processing
      appears a promising new tool to minimize lipid oxidation of protein isolates,
      both during their production and subsequent storage. Lingonberry press-cake was
      the most efficient helper but provided dark color which may narrow product
      development possibilities, something which requires further attention.

AB  - Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a multifunctional transcription
      factor that plays an important role in antioxidant activities. However, its
      effect on antioxidant capacity in Litopenaeus vannamei, an economically important
      crustacean, remains unclear. In this study, the role of Nrf2 in response to
      oxidative stress in L. vannamei was determined by its effect on relevant gene
      expression and enzymatic activity. Nrf2 was cloned and analyzed. Results revealed
      that Nrf2 contains a 1575 bp open reading frame encoding 524 amino acids and a
      conserved bZIP Maf domain. The sequence similarity of Nrf2 between L. vannamei
      and Homarus americanus is 81%. Although the Nrf2 expression was detected in all
      tissues, the Nrf2 expression levels were the highest in the hepatopancreas,
      followed by the eyestalk and muscle. RNA interference significantly decreased the
      expression of antioxidant-related genes (SOD, GPX, CAT, Trx, and HO-1; p < 0.05),
      significantly upregulated the expression of autophagy genes (Atg3, Atg4, Atg5,
      Atg10, and Atg12; p < 0.05) and apoptosis genes (Caspase-3 and P53; p < 0.05).
      Moreover, SOD, CAT, and GPX enzyme activities decreased whereas the MDA activity 
      increased. The histological results of the shrimp injected with dsRNA-Nrf2 showed
      that the hepatic tubules were irregularly arranged, the lumen was abnormal, and a
      few hepatic tubules were significantly enlarged compared with those of the
      dsRNA-EGFP group. The hepatocytes were also vacuolated. In conclusion, this study
      provided evidence that Nrf2 is involved in the regulation of antioxidant
      capacity, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and autophagy in shrimp.

AB  - Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND), formerly called early mortality 
      syndrome (EMS), causes high mortality in cultured penaeid shrimp, particularly
      Penaeus vannamei and Penaeus monodon. AHPND is mainly caused by Vibrio species
      carrying the pVA1 plasmid encoding the virulence genes Photorhabdus
      insect-related (pir) pir (VP) A and pir (VP) B. We developed a new molecular
      assay that combines recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and CRISPR/Cas12a 
      technology (RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a) to detect pir (VP) A and pir (VP) B, with a
      fluorescent signal result. The fluorescence RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a assay had a
      detection limit of 20 copies/muL for pir (VP) A and pir (VP) B. To improve
      usability and visualize RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a assay results, a lateral flow strip
      readout was added. With the lateral flow strip, the RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a assay had a
      lower limit of detection of 200 copies/muL (0.3 fmol/L). The lateral flow assay
      can be completed in 2 h and showed no cross-reactivity with pathogens causing
      other shrimp diseases. In a field test of 60 shrimp samples, the
      RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a lateral flow assay showed 92.5% positive predictive agreement
      and 100% negative predictive agreement. As the new RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a assay is
      rapid, specific, and does not require complicated experimental equipment, it may 
      have important field applications for detecting AHPND in farmed shrimp.

TI  - Genome assembly of the Australian black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) reveals a 
      novel fragmented IHHNV EVE sequence.

AB  - Shrimp are a valuable aquaculture species globally; however, disease remains a
      major hindrance to shrimp aquaculture sustainability and growth. Mechanisms
      mediated by endogenous viral elements have been proposed as a means by which
      shrimp that encounter a new virus start to accommodate rather than succumb to
      infection over time. However, evidence on the nature of such endogenous viral
      elements and how they mediate viral accommodation is limited. More extensive
      genomic data on Penaeid shrimp from different geographical locations should
      assist in exposing the diversity of endogenous viral elements. In this context,
      reported here is a PacBio Sequel-based draft genome assembly of an Australian
      black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) inbred for 1 generation. The 1.89 Gbp draft 
      genome is comprised of 31,922 scaffolds (N50: 496,398 bp) covering 85.9% of the
      projected genome size. The genome repeat content (61.8% with 30% representing
      simple sequence repeats) is almost the highest identified for any species. The
      functional annotation identified 35,517 gene models, of which 25,809 were
      protein-coding and 17,158 were annotated using interproscan. Scaffold scanning
      for specific endogenous viral elements identified an element comprised of a
      9,045-bp stretch of repeated, inverted, and jumbled genome fragments of
      infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus bounded by a repeated
      591/590 bp host sequence. As only near complete linear approximately 4 kb
      infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus genomes have been found
      integrated in the genome of P. monodon previously, its discovery has implications
      regarding the validity of PCR tests designed to specifically detect such linear
      endogenous viral element types. The existence of joined inverted infectious
      hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus genome fragments also provides a
      means by which hairpin double-stranded RNA could be expressed and processed by
      the shrimp RNA interference machinery.

AB  - Molecularly imprinted polymers were synthesized by gel-sol method with
      multi-walled carbon nanotubes as support and enrofloxacin as a template and
      further modified on the surface of glassy carbon electrode to construct a
      molecularly imprinted electrochemical sensor. The performance of the imprinted
      electrochemical sensor was thoroughly investigated by using cyclic voltammetry
      and differential pulse voltammetry. The influence of imprinted polymers amount,
      electrolyte pH, and incubation time on the sensor performance was investigated
      for the detection of enrofloxacin. Under the optimal experimental conditions in a
      three-electrode system with the modified electrode as the working electrode the
      differential pulse voltammetry response current of the sensor had a good linear
      relationship at 0.2 V (vs. saturated calomel reference electrode) with the
      enrofloxacin concentration within 2.8 pM-28 muM and the limit of detection of the
      method was 0.9 pM. The competitive interference experiment showed that the
      imprinted electrochemical sensor could selectively recognize enrofloxacin. The
      method was applied to analyze spiked natural seawater, fish, and shrimp samples. 
      The recovery was 96.4%-102%, and RSD was less than 4.3% (n = 3), indicating that 
      the proposed imprinted electrochemical sensor was suitable for the determination 
      of trace enrofloxacin in marine environment samples.

      freshwater shrimp after dimethoate treatment?

AB  - Insecticides such as dimethoate persist for a long time in freshwater
      environments, influencing the physiology of the animals inhabiting such
      environments. In aquatic organisms, toxic substances can enter the body through
      the epidermis and the digestive system. The midgut is part of this system in
      which intense processes constitute a barrier against the effects of toxic
      substances on the body. The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxic potential
      of dimethoate in the midgut epithelium of the freshwater shrimp Neocaridina
      davidi, emphasizing ultrastructural alterations. However, the additional and main
      purpose was to determine whether the midgut epithelium can regenerate after
      placing animals in insecticide-free clean water after various periods of exposure
      to dimethoate. N. davidi originates from Asia, but it has also been described in 
      European rivers. This species is of particular interest among breeders worldwide 
      due to its ease of breeding and reproduction. The animals were treated with
      dimethoate for 1, 2, and 3 weeks and then placed in clean water for 1, 2, and 3
      weeks. The qualitative and quantitative analysis revealed different sensitivity
      of organs forming the midgut in freshwater crustaceans and the possibility for
      midgut regeneration after insecticide exposure. We concluded that different
      processes were triggered in the intestine and hepatopancreas to regenerate cells 
      after damage, and mitochondria were the first organelles to respond to the
      appearance of a stressor in the living environment.

TI  - A Bayesian belief data mining approach applied to rice and shrimp aquaculture.

AB  - In many parts of the world, conditions for small scale agriculture are worsening,
      creating challenges in achieving consistent yields. The use of automated decision
      support tools, such as Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs), can assist producers to
      respond to these factors. This paper describes a decision support system
      developed to assist farmers on the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, who grow both rice and 
      shrimp crops in the same pond, based on an existing BBN. The BBN was previously
      developed in collaboration with local farmers and extension officers to represent
      their collective perceptions and understanding of their farming system and the
      risks to production that they face. This BBN can be used to provide insight into 
      the probable consequences of farming decisions, given prevailing environmental
      conditions, however, it does not provide direct guidance on the optimal decision 
      given those decisions. In this paper, the BBN is analysed using a novel,
      temporally-inspired data mining approach to systematically determine the
      agricultural decisions that farmers perceive as optimal at distinct periods in
      the growing and harvesting cycle, given the prevailing agricultural conditions.
      Using a novel form of data mining that combines with visual analytics, the
      results of this analysis allow the farmer to input the environmental conditions
      in a given growing period. They then receive recommendations that represent the
      collective view of the expert knowledge encoded in the BBN allowing them to
      maximise the probability of successful crops. Encoding the results of the data
      mining/inspection approach into the mobile Decision Support System helps farmers 
      access explicit recommendations from the collective local farming community as to
      the optimal farming decisions, given the prevailing environmental conditions.

TI  - Large and exaggerated sexually selected weapons comprise high proportions of
      metabolically inexpensive exoskeleton.
PG  - 20210550
LID - 10.1098/rsbl.2021.0550 [doi]
AB  - The cost-minimization hypothesis proposes that positive allometry in sexually
      selected traits can be explained if the proportional energetic maintenance costs 
      of weapons decrease as traits increase in size. Energetic maintenance costs are
      the costs of maintaining homeostasis. They are slow, persistent energy sinks that
      are distinct from ephemeral costs of growth. Because some tissues expend more
      energy on maintenance than others, energetic maintenance costs can be inferred
      from proportional tissue composition. For example, soft tissues require more
      energy for maintenance than exoskeleton, so an arthropod claw that is 50% soft
      tissue and 50% exoskeleton would have higher energetic maintenance costs than one
      that is 30% soft tissue and 70% exoskeleton. I tested the cost-minimization
      hypothesis using proportional tissue composition as a proxy for energetic
      maintenance costs in snapping shrimp (Alpheus heterochaelis and Alpheus
      estuariensis) and fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator). As predicted, larger weapons
      comprised proportionally less soft tissue mass and more exoskeleton mass than
      smaller weapons. Furthermore, I extended cost-minimization to explain trait
      exaggeration: individuals might exaggerate traits by investing more mass in
      exoskeleton. As predicted, exoskeleton mass proportional to weapon mass increased
      as exaggeration increased. These results support and extend the cost-minimization
      hypothesis to explain positive allometry and weapon exaggeration.

TI  - Programmable motion control and trajectory manipulation of microparticles through
      tri-directional symmetrical acoustic tweezers.
PG  - 1149-1161
LID - 10.1039/d2lc00046f [doi]
AB  - Acoustic tweezers based on travelling surface acoustic waves (TSAWs) have the
      potential for contactless trajectory manipulation and motion-parameter regulation
      of microparticles in biological and microfluidic applications. Here, we present a
      novel design of a tri-directional symmetrical acoustic tweezers device that
      enables the precise manipulation of linear, clockwise, and anticlockwise
      trajectories of microparticles. By switching the excitation combinations of
      interdigital electrodes (IDTs), various shape patterns of acoustic pressure
      fields can be formed to capture and steer microparticles accurately according to 
      pre-defined trajectories. Numerical simulations and experimental tests were
      conducted in this study. By adjusting the input electric signals and the fluid's 
      viscosity, the device is able to manipulate microparticles of various forms as
      well as brine shrimp egg cells with the accurate modulation of motion parameters.
      The results show that the proposed programmable design possesses low-cost,
      compact, non-contact, and high biocompatibility benefits, with the capacity to
      accurately manage microparticles in a range of motion trajectories, independent
      of their physical and/or chemical characteristics. Thus, our design has strong
      potential applications in chemical composition analysis, drug delivery, and cell 
      assembly.

AB  - Probiotics are increasingly used in aquaculture to protect cultivated organisms
      from pathogens and improve water quality and feed efficiency. Shrimp are the most
      commonly cultivated aquaculture species worldwide. In this current review, we
      will explore the current challenges that impact shrimp aquaculture and summarize 
      how probiotics are utilized to improve production. Probiotics are live
      microorganisms that are described as friendly bacteria or healthy bacteria
      supplemented to the shrimp gut through feeds. Probiotics have been demonstrated
      to increase gastrointestinal stability, secrete antibacterial compounds, compete 
      with pathogens to prevent intestinal adhesion, compete for the nutrients required
      for pathogen survival and produce antitoxin effects. Probiotics can also modulate
      the immune system and control the allergic response of the body. Therefore, this 
      review sheds light on the challenges faced in shrimp production as well as the
      different types of probiotics, their methods of application, their modes of
      action, their role in improving shrimp production, and their influence on water
      quality.

TI  - The Hedgehog pathway in penaeid shrimp: developmental expression and evolution of
      splice junctions in Pancrustacea.
PG  - 87-96
LID - 10.1007/s10709-022-00151-z [doi]
AB  - Penaeid shrimp embryos undergo holoblastic division, gastrulation by
      invagination, and hatching as a nauplius larva. Posterior segments form and
      differentiate during larval development. Hedgehog (Hh) pathway genes from penaeid
      shrimp and other pancrustaceans were identified by in silico analysis of genomes 
      and transcriptomes, and mapped onto a recent pancrustacean phylogeny to determine
      patterns of intron gains and losses. Penaeus vannamei, P. japonicus, and P.
      monodon Hh proteins were encoded by four exons. Amphipod, isopod, and ostracod hh
      were also encoded by four exons, but hh from other arthropod groups contained
      three conserved exons. The novel hh intron is hypothesized to have arisen
      independently in the malacostracan ancestor and Ostracoda by a transposon
      insertion. Shared patterns of ptc, smo, and ci exon structure were found for
      Malacostraca, Branchiopoda + Hexapoda, Hexanauplia (Thecostraca + Copepoda),
      Multicrustacea (Thecostraca + Copepoda + Malacostraca), and Pancrustacea minus
      Oligostraca. mRNA expression of P. vannamei of hh, ptc, and ci from developmental
      transcriptomes of zygotes through postlarvae showed low expression from zygote to
      gastrula, which increased at limb bud, peaked at unhatched nauplius, and declined
      in nauplius and later larval stages. smo expression was found in zygotes, peaked 
      in gastrula, and declined in limb bud and later stages. These results are
      consistent with a role for Hh signaling during segmentation in penaeid shrimp.

TI  - Microbial community composition associated with early developmental stages of the
      Indian white shrimp, Penaeus indicus.

LID - 10.1007/s00438-022-01865-7 [doi]
AB  - Gut microbiota is known to influence the physiology, health, nutrient absorption,
      reproduction, and other metabolic activities of aquatic organisms. Microbial
      composition can influence intestinal immunity and are considered as health
      indicators. Information on gut microbial composition provides potential
      application possibilities to improve shrimp health and production. In the absence
      of such information for Penaeus indicus, the present study reports the microbial 
      community structure associated with its early developmental stages. Bacterial
      community associated with the early developmental stages (egg, nauplii, zoea,
      mysis, PL1, PL6 and PL12) from two hatchery cycles were analysed employing 16S
      rRNA high throughput sequencing. Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, were the two
      dominant phyla in P. indicus development stages. Sequential sampling revealed the
      constant change in the bacterial composition at genus level. Alteromonas was
      dominant in egg and nauplii stage, whilst Ascidiaceihabitans (formerly
      Roseobacter) was the dominant genera in both PL6 and PL12. The bacterial
      composition was highly dynamic in early stages and our study suggests that the
      mysis stage is the critical phase in transforming the microbial composition and
      it gets stabilised by early post larval stages. This is the first report on the
      composition of microbiota in early developmental stages of P. indicus. Based on
      these results the formation of microbial composition seems to be influenced by

AB  - CRISPR/Cas9 technology has been applied to many arthropods. However, application 
      of this technology to crustaceans remains limited because of the unique
      characteristics of embryos. Our group has developed a microinjection system to
      introduce the CRISPR/Cas9 system into Neocaridina heteropoda embryos (one-cell
      stage). Using the developed method, we mutated the target gene Nh-scarlet (N.
      heteropoda scarlet), which functions in eye development and pigmentation. The
      results showed that both eye color and shape were altered in individuals in which
      Nh-scarlet was knocked out. Furthermore, this system was also successfully
      applied to another decapod crustacean, Eriocheir sinensis. DNA sequencing
      revealed that the zoeae with red eyes had an edited version of Es-scarlet. This
      study provides a stable microinjection method for freshwater crustaceans, and
      will contribute to functional genomics studies in various decapods.

AB  - This study applied bisindolylmaleimide I (BSM), a pharmacological competitive
      inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC) enzymatic activity, at 1.25 pmol shrimp(-1)
      for 60 min to investigate the potential involvement of PKC in signal transduction
      pathways in the hemocytes of Litopenaeus vannamei. A novel PKC in L. vannamei
      (LvnPKC) was identified and characterized and was determined to be involved in
      mediating the neuroendocrine-immune regulatory network. The hemocytes of L.
      vannamei that receive BSM exhibit significantly decreased PKC activity and LvnPKC
      gene and protein expression levels. Furthermore, the total hemocyte count,
      hyaline cells, and semigranular cells increased significantly along with
      significant decreases in granular cells, and meanwhile, the significantly
      increased phenoloxidase activity, respiratory bursts, superoxide dismutase (SOD) 
      activity, phagocytic activity, and neutrophil extracellular trap were observed;
      however, phagocytic activity decreased significantly. In a molecular model, the
      gene expressions of lipopolysaccharide- and beta-1,3-glucan-binding protein,
      peroxinectin, cytosolic manganese SOD, mitochondrial manganese SOD, and
      copper/zinc SOD in the hemocytes of L. vannamei that had received BSM decreased
      significantly, but prophenoloxidase I increased significantly. In catecholamine
      biosynthesis, tyrosine, dopamine, and norepinephrine decreased significantly in
      the hemocytes of L. vannamei that had received BSM, and l-dihydroxyphenylalanine 
      increased. Moreover, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity increased significantly, 
      whereas TH and dihydroxyphenylalanine decarboxylase gene expression decreased
      significantly. These findings suggest that BSM inhibits PKC activity in hemocytes
      in which LvnPKC gene and protein expression are also inhibited. Additionally, the
      hemocytes' immunocompetence, including their prophenoloxidase and antioxidant
      systems, phagocytic activity, and catecholamine biosynthesis, was disrupted,
      confirming the roles of LvnPKC in mediating the neuroendocrine-immune regulatory 
      network in hemocytes.

AB  - The effects of six kinds of thermal processing on soluble protein recovery,
      potential allergenicity, in vitro digestibility and structural characteristics of
      shrimp soluble proteins were evaluated. Obtained results confirmed soluble
      protein recovery and IgG/IgE reactivity of shrimp soluble extracts were markedly 
      suppressed by various thermal treatments with enhanced digestibility depended on 
      the extent and type of heating applied, which correlated well with the structural
      alterations and modification. The maximum reduction of IgG/IgE-binding capacity
      and digestive stability were observed in the autoclaved shrimps because of
      unfolding of protein and hydrophobic residues exposed. Notably, tropomyosin (TM) 
      and sarcoplasmic calcium-binding protein (SCP) were still IgG/IgE-reactive in
      various heat-processed shrimps, even higher IgG reactivity were found in
      heat-treated shrimps TM according to TM antiserum western-blotting and indirect
      ELISA results. Shrimp TM and SCP maintains its IgE/IgG-binding capacity after
      various cooking methods, thus most probably initiating allergic sensitization to 
      both raw and cooked shrimps.

TI  - Integrated Analysis of mRNA-Seq and MiRNA-Seq Reveals the Molecular Mechanism of 
      the Intestinal Immune Response in Marsupenaeus japonicus Under Decapod Iridescent
      Virus 1 Infection.
PG  - 807093
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2021.807093 [doi]
AB  - The intestine is not only an important digestive organ but also an important
      immune organ for shrimp; it plays a key role in maintaining homeostasis. Decapod 
      iridescent virus 1 (DIV1) is a new type of shrimp-lethal virus that has received 
      extensive attention in recent years. To date, most studies of the shrimp
      intestinal immune response under viral infections have relied on single omics
      analyses; there is a lack of systematic multi-omics research. In the current
      study, intestinal mRNA-seq and microRNA (miRNA)-seq analyses of Marsupenaeus
      japonicus under DIV1 infection were performed. A total of 1,976 differentially
      expressed genes (DEGs) and 32 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were
      identified. Among them, 21 DEMs were negatively correlated with 194 DEGs from a
      total of 223 correlations. Functional annotation analysis revealed that M.
      japonicus can regulate glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis (chondroitin sulfate,
      dermatan sulfate, and keratan sulfate), vitamin metabolism (retinol metabolism
      and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism), immune pathway activation (Toll and IMD
      signaling pathways, Wnt signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, and Hippo
      signaling pathway), immunity enzyme activity promotion (triose-phosphate
      isomerase), antimicrobial peptide (AMP) expression, reactive oxygen species (ROS)
      production, and cell apoptosis through miRNAs to participate in the host's
      antiviral immune response, while DIV1 can influence Warburg effect-related
      pathways (pyruvate metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and citrate cycle),
      glycosphingolipid biosynthesis-related pathways (glycosphingolipid
      biosynthesis-globo and isoglobo series and glycosphingolipid biosynthesis-lacto
      and neolacto series), and the tight junction and adhesion junction of the
      intestinal mucosal epithelium through the host's miRNAs and mRNA to promote its
      own invasion and replication. These results indicate that intestinal miRNAs play 
      important roles in the shrimp immune response against DIV1 infection. This study 
      provides a basis for further study of the shrimp intestinal antiviral immune
      response and for the formulation of effective new strategies for the prevention
      and treatment of DIV1 infection.

TI  - Impact of test chamber design on spontaneous behavioral responses of model
      crustacean zooplankton Artemia franciscana.

AB  - The use of small aquatic model organisms to investigate the behavioral effects of
      chemical exposure is becoming an integral component of aquatic ecotoxicology
      research and neuroactive drug discovery. Despite the increasing use of
      invertebrates for behavioral phenotyping in toxicological studies and chemical
      risk assessments, little is known regarding the potential for environmental
      factors-such as geometry, size, opacity and depth of test chambers-to modulate
      common behavioral responses. In this work, we demonstrate that test chamber
      geometry, size, opacity and depth can affect spontaneous, unstimulated behavioral
      responses of euryhaline crustacean Artemia franciscana first instar larval
      stages. We found that in the absence of any obvious directional cues, A.
      franciscana exhibited a strong innate wall preference behavior. Using different
      test chamber sizes and geometries, we found both increased wall preference and
      lowered overall distance traveled by the test shrimp in a smaller chamber with
      sharper-angled vertices. It was also determined through quantifiable changes in
      the chambers' color that the A. franciscana early larval stages can perceive,
      differentiate and react to differences in color or perhaps rather to light
      transmittance of the test chambers. The interaction between innate edge
      preference and positive phototaxis could be consistently altered with a novel
      photic stimulus system. We also observed a strong initial preference for depth in
      A. franciscana first instar larval stages, which diminished through the
      acclimatization. We postulate that the impact of test chamber designs on
      neurobehavioral baseline responses warrants further investigation, in particular 
      considering the increased interest in behavioral eco-neurotoxicology
      applications.

AB  - In this study, the physiology of symbiotic 'peacock-tail' shrimp Ancylocaris
      brevicarpalis and its host 'Haddon's carpet' sea anemone Stichodactyla haddoni
      were tested under lowered pH (7.7) and control (8.1) conditions. The biochemical 
      responses such as digestive enzyme (AP), organic acids (lactate and succinate),
      oxidative damages (MDA), antioxidants metabolites/enzymes (ASC, GSH, SOD, CAT,
      APX, GPX, GR, POX, and PHOX), and detoxification enzyme (GST) were measured. The 
      AP showed insignificantly reduced values in both the organisms in lowered pH
      conditions compared to control indicating the effect of abiotic stress. The
      hierarchical clustering analysis indicated low MDA in sea anemone can be
      explained by higher POX, APX, GR, ASC, and GSH levels compared to shrimps.
      However, the detoxification enzyme GST showed less activity in sea anemones
      compared to shrimps. The results suggest that A. brevicarpalis and sea anemone S.
      haddoni may have deleterious effects when exposed to short-term acidification
      stress.

TI  - Circulating trimethylamine N-oxide levels following fish or seafood consumption.
PG  - 2357-2364
LID - 10.1007/s00394-022-02803-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Some species of fish and seafood are high in trimethylamine N-oxide
      (TMAO), which accumulates in muscle where it protects against pressure and cold. 
      Trimethylamine (TMA), the metabolic precursor to TMAO, is formed in fish during
      bacterial spoilage. Fish intake is promoted for its potential cardioprotective
      effects. However, numerous studies show TMAO has pro-atherothrombotic properties.
      Here, we determined the effects of fish or seafood consumption on circulating
      TMAO levels in participants with normal renal function. METHODS: TMAO and omega-3
      fatty acid content were quantified across multiple different fish or seafood
      species by mass spectrometry. Healthy volunteers (n = 50) were recruited for
      three studies. Participants in the first study consented to 5 consecutive weekly 
      blood draws and provided dietary recall for the 24 h preceding each draw. In the 
      second study, TMAO levels were determined following defined low and high TMAO
      diets. Finally, participants consumed test meals containing shrimp, tuna, fish
      sticks, salmon or cod. TMAO levels were quantified by mass spectrometry in blood 
      collected before and after dietary challenge. RESULTS: TMAO + TMA content varied 
      widely across fish and seafood species. Consumption of fish sticks, cod, and to a
      lesser extent salmon led to significant increases in circulating TMAO levels.
      Within 1 day, circulating TMAO concentrations in all participants returned to
      baseline levels. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that some fish and seafood contain high
      levels of TMAO, and may induce a transient elevation in TMAO levels in some
      individuals. Selection of low TMAO content fish is prudent for subjects with
      elevated TMAO, cardiovascular disease or impaired renal function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the past few years, the production of shrimp shell waste from the 
      seafood processing industries has confronted a significant surge. Furthermore,
      insignificant dumping of waste has dangerous effects on both nature and human
      well-being. This marine waste contains a huge quantity of chitin which has
      several applications in different fields. The chitinase enzyme can achieve
      degradation of chitin, and the chitin itself can be used as the substrate as well
      for production of chitinase. In the current study, the chitinase enzyme was
      produced by Thermomyces lanuginosus. The extracellular chitinase was purified
      from crude extract using ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by
      DEAE-cellulose ion-exchange chromatography and Sephadex G-100 gel filtration
      chromatography. The stability and activity of chitinase with different pH,
      temperature, different times for a reaction, in the presence of different metal
      ions, and different concentration of enzyme and substrate were analyzed. RESULT: 
      The chitinase activity was found to be highest at pH 6.5, 50 degrees C, and 60
      min after the reaction began. and the chitinase showed the highest activity and
      stability in the presence of beta-mercaptoethanol (ME). The SDS-PAGE of denatured
      purified chitinase showed a protein band of 18 kDa. CONCLUSION: The
      characterization study concludes that Cu(2+), Hg(2+), and EDTA have an inhibitory
      effect on chitinase activity, whereas beta-ME acts as an activator for chitinase 
      activity. The utilization of chitin to produce chitinase and the degradation of
      chitin using that chitinase enzyme would be an opportunity for bioremediation of 
      shrimp shell waste.

AB  - The pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) remains unclear; however,
      inflammation is involved in PCOS progression and can be regulated by diet. We
      therefore hypothesized that diet may play an important role in the process of
      PCOS. This study aimed to investigate specific dietary patterns associated with
      PCOS through a case-control study involving 527 participants and conducted in
      Fuzhou, China. The dietary inflammatory index (DII) was calculated using a
      dietary frequency questionnaire, and the dietary pattern was obtained through a
      principal component analysis (PCA). Logistic regression was used for risk
      estimation, and the correlations were investigated by partial correlation
      analysis. The PCA identified a Mediterranean diet, a meat-egg diet, a
      shellfish-shrimp-dairy diet, and a staple food-soybean diet. The meat-egg (odds
      ratio [OR] = 1.404; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.163-1.695) and
      shellfish-shrimp-dairy (OR = 1.287; 95% CI, 1.057-1.568) diets increased the risk
      of PCOS. The Mediterranean diet (OR = 0.759; 95% CI, 0.624-0.922) was identified 
      as a protective factor and was negatively correlated with the DII. The DII scores
      ranged from -4.64 to 4.79 and were positively correlated with the risk of PCOS
      (OR = 1.141; 95% CI, 1.050-1.240). After adjusting for covariates, the
      platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII),
      neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and DII were positively correlated in PCOS 
      (P < .001, P = .001, and P < .001, respectively). In conclusion, certain dietary 
      patterns are associated with PCOS. Pro-inflammatory diets increase the risk of
      PCOS, and the DII was negatively correlated with the Mediterranean diet and
      positively correlated with the PLR, NLR, and SII.

AB  - Until the Covid-19 pandemic, Bangladesh had reported consistent improvements
      regarding its food and nutrition security (FNS) status, and yet, the country
      still features poor FNS outcomes among parts of its population. In rural coastal 
      regions of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta, farming households' vulnerability
      is particularly exacerbated by a range of environmental hazards, increasing
      challenges for agriculture to contribute to higher FNS levels. In the context of 
      existing literature on the trade-offs between subsistence agriculture and
      cash-earning livelihood activities, vis-a-vis food and nutrition security
      outcomes, this article assesses the relative contribution of crop diversification
      vis a vis other factors on the households' Food Consumption Score (FCS) in
      specific livelihood contexts. We provide differentiated analyses between
      primarily export-oriented shrimp farming and non-shrimp farming households, so
      policy makers can better address FNS targets. Quantitative data from 1,188 sample
      households across the delta were analysed through descriptive and linear
      regression analyses. Results show that households cultivating shrimp have a
      significantly higher dietary diversity than households that do not. Among shrimp 
      farmers, crop diversification has the relatively strongest significant positive
      effect on dietary diversity, suggesting part of the aquacultural crops are geared
      towards subsistence. By contrast, crop diversification seems to have a negative
      effect on dietary diversity among households that do not produce shrimp,
      especially when different agricultural crops are combined. Importantly, both for 
      shrimp and non-shrimp farmers, crop diversification systems combining agriculture
      with aquaculture, and agroforestry seem to improve diverse diets among
      households. While by no means a panacea to solving FNS challenges among rural
      households, we suggest that promoting specific crop diversification systems could
      be a beneficial pathway to improved FNS outcomes.

AB  - Chitosan is a natural alkaline polysaccharide, which widely exists in marine
      crustaceans such as shrimp and crab, has been shown to have various biological
      activities. It has attracted considerable attention in biomedicine and
      nanomaterials fields because of its excellent properties, such as
      biocompatibility, biodegradability, non-toxicity and easy access. In addition,
      because of active hydroxyl and amino groups in chitosan molecules, different
      functional groups can be introduced into chitosan molecules by molecular
      modification or chemical modification, which extends their applications.
      Nanoparticles with small size and large surface area can be used as diagnostic
      and therapeutic tools in the biomedical field, which make it easier to
      understand, detect and treat human diseases. The nanomaterials based on chitosan 
      have important applications in biomedicine, industry, pharmacy, agriculture, and 
      other fields. This review highlights the recent advances on chitosan-based
      nanoparticles for antibacterial property, drug and gene delivery, cancer and
      hyperthermia therapy, cell imaging, restorative dentistry, wound healing, tissue 
      engineering and other biomedical fields. The nanotechnology fields involving
      biosensors, water treatment, food industry and agriculture are also briefly
      reviewed.

AB  - Clip domain serine proteinases participate in invertebrate innate immunity by
      acting as crucial enzymes in the signaling cascade involved in shrimp immunity.
      To functionally characterize its role in Fenneropenaeus merguiensis, FmclipSP
      cDNA was cloned and characterized. The FmclipSP gene comprised 1353 bp with an
      open reading frame of 1110 bp and encoded 369 amino acids. The protein contained 
      clip and serine protease domains. FmClipSP mRNA is highly expressed in hemocytes,
      and its expression was significantly upregulated by bacterial or viral pathogen
      challenge. Furthermore, FmClipSP recombinant protein (rFmClipSP) was produced and
      possessed protease activity, stimulating prophenoloxidase activity. Additionally,
      rFmClipSP exhibited antibacterial activity against pathogens and nonpathogens.
      ELISA results demonstrated the binding ability of rFmClipSP to a recombinant
      protein of VP28 (rVP28). Interestingly, the binding significantly inhibited
      prophenoloxidase activity. Altogether, we partially characterized the function of
      FmclipSP and demonstrated its association with VP28. This study indicates the
      importance of clipSP as a component of F. merguiensis innate immunity. However,
      the role of clipSP in crustaceans remains unclear and requires further
      investigation.

AB  - The accumulation of antimicrobial residues in edible animal products and
      aquaculture products could pose health concerns to unsuspecting consumers. Hence,
      this study aimed to develop a validated method for simultaneous quantification of
      chloramphenicol (CAP), thiamphenicol (TAP), florfenicol (FF), and florfenicol
      amine (FFA) in beef, pork, chicken, shrimp, eel, and flatfish using a quick,
      easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) extraction method coupled
      with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Primary-secondary
      amine (PSA) and MgSO4 were used for sample purification. The analytes were
      separated on a reversed-phase analytical column. The coefficients of
      determination for the linear matrix-matched calibration curves were >/=0.9941.
      Recovery rates ranged between 64.26 and 116.51% for the four analytes with
      relative standard deviations (RSDs) </= 18.05%. The calculated limits of
      detection (LODs) and limits of quantification (LOQs) were 0.005-3.1 and 0.02-10.4
      mug/kg, respectively. The developed method was successfully applied for
      monitoring samples obtained from local markets in Seoul, Republic of Korea. The
      target residues were not detected in any tested matrix. The designed method was
      versatile, sensitive, and proved suitable for quantifying residues in
      animal-derived products.

AB  - Biofloc technology (BFT) is gaining traction as a strategic aquaculture tool for 
      boosting feed conversions, biosecurity, and wastewater recycling. The significant
      aspect of BFT is aquaculture with highest stocking density and minimal water
      exchange. It not only improves the water quality of a system by removing
      inorganic nitrogen from wastewater but also serves as a suitable feed supplement 
      and probiotic source for cultured species. This technology is commonly used for
      shrimp and tilapia culture and can be used for both semi-intensive and intensive 
      culture systems. Biofloc, when combined with formulated diets, forms a balanced
      food chain that improves growth performance. Nutrients in this system are
      continuously recycled and reused and form an efficient alternative system in
      aquaculture. In addition to the reduction in water exchange, it is also
      considered as a bio-security measure, since it prevents entry of disease from
      outside sources. Aquamimicry is an innovative concept that simulates natural
      estuarine conditions by developing copepods that act as supplementary nutrition
      especially for shrimp culture. The review highlights the process, significance,
      and development of BFT, its microbial interactions, nutritional value, transition
      from biofloc to copefloc, and concept of aquamimicry to sustainably improve
      aquaculture production.

TI  - Single-Cell Ribonucleic Acid Sequencing Clarifies Cold Tolerance Mechanisms in
      the Pacific White Shrimp (Litopenaeus Vannamei).
PG  - 792172

AB  - To characterize the cold tolerance mechanism of the Pacific white shrimp
      (Litopenaeus vannamei), we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of
      approximately 5185 hepatopancreas cells from cold-tolerant (Lv-T) and common
      (Lv-C) L. vannamei at preferred and low temperatures (28 degrees C and 10 degrees
      C, respectively). The cells fell into 10 clusters and 4 cell types: embryonic,
      resorptive, blister-like, and fibrillar. We identified differentially expressed
      genes between Lv-T and Lv-C, which were mainly associated with the terms "immune 
      system," "cytoskeleton," "antioxidant system," "digestive enzyme," and
      "detoxification," as well as the pathways "metabolic pathways of oxidative
      phosphorylation," "metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450," "chemical
      carcinogenesis," "drug metabolism-cytochrome P450," and "fatty acid metabolism." 
      Reconstruction of fibrillar cell trajectories showed that, under low temperature 
      stress, hepatopancreas cells had two distinct fates, cell fate 1 and cell fate 2.
      Cell fate 1 was mainly involved in signal transduction and sensory organ
      development. Cell fate 2 was mainly involved in metabolic processes. This study
      preliminarily clarifies the molecular mechanisms underlying cold tolerance in L. 
      vannamei, which will be useful for the breeding of shrimp with greater cold
      tolerance.

AB  - Nowadays, the application of immunomodulators in aquaculture has become of an
      urgent need because of high incidence of fish and shrimp diseases. For a long
      time, researchers have paid great interest to find suitable, relatively
      economical, and environmentally safe immunostimulant products to be used either
      as feed or water additives to boost immunity and increase the resistance of fish 
      and shrimp against the challenging pathogens. Probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics,
      phytobiotics, herbal extracts, microalgae, macroalgae, and essential oils have
      been extensively evaluated. Brown seaweeds (Phaeophyceae) are a large group of
      multi-cellular macroalgae that are widely distributed in marine aquatic
      environments. They are abundant in several bioactive sulfated polysaccharides
      known as fucoidan (FCD). Research studies demonstrated the beneficial functions
      of FCD in human medicine because of its immunomodulating, antioxidant,
      anti-allergic, antitumor, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and hepatoprotective
      effects. In aquaculture, several researchers have tested the benefits and
      potential applications of FCD in aquafeed. This literature review provides an
      updated information and key references of research studies that focused
      principally on using FCD in aquaculture. Its effects on growth, intestinal
      health, antioxidant capacity, and immune responses of several finfish and
      shellfish species will be discussed. This review paper will also highlight the
      potential efficacy and mechanisms of FCD in the modulation of toxicity signs and 
      increasing the resistance of fish and shrimp against bacterial and viral
      infections. Hence, this contribution will be valuable to maintain aquaculture
      sustainability and to improve the health and welfare of farmed fish and shrimp.

AB  - Protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are the most common and important
      regulatory mechanisms in signal transduction, which play a vital role in immune
      defense response. Our previous study has found the level of tyrosine
      phosphorylation was significantly changed in the hemocytes of Fenneropenaeus
      chinensis upon white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection. In order to explore
      the relationship between protein phosphorylation and WSSV infection, the
      quantitative phosphoproteomics was employed to identify differential
      phosphorylated proteins in hemocytes of F. chinensis before and after WSSV
      infection, and elucidate the role of key differential phosphorylated proteins in 
      WSSV infection process. The results showed that a total of 147 differential
      phosphorylated proteins were identified in the hemocytes, including 64
      phosphorylated proteins and 83 dephosphorylated proteins, which were mostly
      enriched in pyruvate metabolism, TCA cycle, glycolysis, and ribosomal
      biosynthesis. Functional analysis of differential phosphorylated proteins showed 
      that they were involved in cell apoptosis, cell phagocytosis, cell metabolism and
      antiviral infection. A total of 236 differential phosphorylation sites were
      found, including 91 modified sites in the phosphorylation proteins and 145
      modified sites in the dephosphorylation proteins. Motif analysis showed that
      these phosphorylation sites could activate mitogen-activated protein kinase, P70 
      S6 kinase and other kinases in hemocytes. Moveover, the phosphorylation levels of
      eukaryotic protein initiation factor 4E binding proteins and histone H3 were
      further determined by ELISA and Western blotting, which both exhibited a
      significant increase post WSSV infection and reach their peak levels at 6 and 12 
      h, respectively. Moreover, we found that lactate, a metabolite closely related to
      pyruvate metabolism, TCA cycle and glycolysis, was significantly increased in the
      hemocytes after WSSV infection. This study revealed the protein phosphorylation
      response in hemocytes of F. chinensis to WSSV infection, which help to clarify
      the response characteristics and virus resistance mechanism of hemocytes in F.
      chinensis, and also facilitate further understanding of the interaction between
      WSSV and shrimp hemocytes.

AB  - Decapod iridescent virus 1 (DIV1) is one of the major pathogens of farmed shrimp.
      In this study, the structural proteins of DIV1 were analyzed by mass
      spectrometry. DIV1 virions were purified from the hemolymph of artificially
      infected Cherax quadricarinatus. The viral proteins were separated by sodium
      dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and a total of 28 protein
      bands were obtained. These protein bands were in-gel digested with trypsin and
      the resulting tryptic peptide mixtures were subjected to liquid chromatography
      with tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Thirty virus-encoded proteins were
      identified. Among them, 6 proteins were predicted to contain transmembrane
      domains, 3 proteins were predicted to contain an Arg-Gly-Asp motif. Nine proteins
      showed significant homology with functionally characterized proteins. Antibodies 
      were produced for these candidate proteins and 23 of them were confirmed to be
      the components of DIV1 virions by Western blotting. This study provides the first
      proteomic analysis of DIV1, which establishes a foundation for further
      investigation of viral infection and replication.

AB  - A magnet-renewable electroanalytical strategy has been initially developed for
      monitoring hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in aquaculture freshwater systems using
      magnetic Fe3O4-loaded silver metal-organic framework (Fe3O4@Ag-MOF). The magnetic
      composites were synthesized by a hydrothermal route and further attached onto the
      magnetic electrodes. It was discovered that the Fe3O4@Ag-MOF-based
      electrochemical sensors could exhibit the extremely sharp and steady signals of
      solid-state Ag/AgCl electrochemistry at a lower potential. Furthermore, the
      highly specific and irreversible S-Cl replacement reactions could occur in the
      presence of H2S, so as to induce the conversion of AgCl into non-electroactive
      Ag2S with the rational decline of Ag/AgCl signals. Importantly, the
      Fe3O4@Ag-MOF-modified electrodes could be renewed simply by the removal of the
      magnet after each of the detection cycles for the next immobilization of
      Fe3O4@Ag-MOF probes. The developed electroanalytical method could facilitate the 
      detection of H2S in the linear range from 4.0 to 1400 nM, with a limit of
      detection down to 2.0 nM. Besides, it was employed to detect H2S in aquaculture
      freshwater samples of fish, crab, and shrimp, showing the satisfactory results.

TI  - Work environment, occupational diseases and accidents among seafood industry
      workers in Greenland.
LID - A05210470 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The seafood industry is the largest industry in Greenland.
      Work-related diseases and accidents appear to constitute health risks in this
      sector. The aim was to describe the prevalence of work-related diseases and
      accidents among workers in the seafood industry in Greenland. METHODS: Data from 
      311 workers included a questionnaire, lung function measurements, skin prick
      tests, blood samples, clinical examinations, personal inhalable dust samples and 
      stationary dust measurements. Accident risk was evaluated by work site
      observations and safety walks. Statistical analyses included mean values and
      percentage distribution. RESULTS: Exposure levels were highest in shrimp
      production; 16.1% were sensitised to snow crab, 10.1% to shrimp and 0.3% to fish;
      5.2% had probable occupational asthma. Regarding accidents, the annual incidence 
      rate per 100 workers was 10.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Workers in the seafood industry in
      Greenland have a high prevalence of sensitisation to work-related allergens and
      occupational asthma closely related to high exposures to shrimp and snow crab
      allergens. The rate of severe workplace injuries was high. Preventive measures
      are required. FUNDING: The Health Science Research Council; The Work Environment

TI  - Synthesis of isatin and its derivatives having antibacterial, antifungal and
      cytotoxic activities.
LID - 10.2174/1570179419666220128091313 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The current objective was to synthesize biologically active Isatin
      derivatives. For this purpose, six (06) chemical entities of Isatin derivatives
      such as 3a-3c and 4a-4c were synthesized from Isatin substrate. METHODS: The pure
      compounds were characterized with the help of 1H-NMR, FT-IR, EIMS spectroscopic
      techniques. The synthesized amines 3a-3c and hydrazones 4a-4c were evaluated for 
      their toxicity potential with the help of brine shrimp bioassay. RESULTS: The
      obtained results revealed that 3c exhibited promising toxicity (LD50 = 1.03 x
      10-5M) against Artemia salina. The pure chemical entities such as, 3a-3c and
      4a-4c were evaluated against four Gram-negative (E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S.
      typhi, S. flexneri) and two Gram-positive (B. subtilis, S. aureus) bacteriae. The
      compound 3a displayed significant activity against two bacterial strains; i.e. P.
      aeruginosa, S. typhi, compound 3c demonstrated significant activity against P.
      aeruginosa. Compound 4b was the most active against S. typhi, displaying greater 
      diameter of the growth of inhibition zone (GIZ) than the standard drug. Compound 
      4c exhibited significant activity against P. aeruginosa, S. typhi. The compounds 
      3a-3c and 4a-4c exhibited moderate to significant antibacterial activity against 
      three out of five strains. Only Compound 3c revealed promising toxicity (LD50 =
      1.03 x 10-5 M) against Artemia salina. Antifungal studies of the compounds 3a-3c 
      and 4a-4c against six fungal cultures; T. longifusus, C. albicans, A. flavus, M. 
      canis, F. solani, and C. glabrata. All the compounds were active against one or
      more pathogens having inhibition (10-90%). 3a exhibited significant inhibition
      i.e. 90% against M. canis, 70% against T. longifusus, Compound 4b further
      displayed significant inhibition (90%) against A. flavus and thus proved to be
      the most active member of the series. CONCLUSION: All compounds showed better
      antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic activities, may provide a ground to
      prepare enhanced molecules with much higher antibacterial activities.

TI  - Newly Hatched Stage I American Lobster (Homarus americanus) Survival Following
      Exposure to Physically and Chemically Dispersed Crude Oil.
PG  - 307-316

AB  - Standard model species are commonly used in toxicity tests due to their
      biological and technical advantages but studying native species increases the
      specificity and relevance of results generated for the potential risk assessment 
      to an ecosystem. Accounting for intraspecies variability and other factors, such 
      as chemical and physical characterization of test medium, is necessary to develop
      a reproducible bioassay for toxicity testing with native species. In this study, 
      larval stage I American lobster (Homarus americanus), a commercially important
      and native species of Atlantic Canada, was used as the test species. Toxicity
      tests were first conducted by exposing lobster larvae to a reference toxicant of 
      copper sulphate (CuSO4) and then to physically and chemically (using Corexit
      9500A) dispersed oil (WAF and CEWAF, respectively). The effect on larval survival
      was estimated by calculating the 24-h median effect concentration (24-h EC50),
      and there was no difference between WAF or CEWAF exposure when the results are
      reported on a total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) basis. The 24-h EC50s ranged from
      2.54 to 9.73 mg TPH/L when all trials (n = 19) are considered together. The HC5
      (hazardous concentration for 5 per cent of the population) value was 2.52 mg
      TPH/L and similar to the EC50 value when all trials were pooled. To evaluate the 
      reproducibility of the lobster toxicity tests, inter-trial variability was
      determined, and the resultant coefficients of variation (%CV) were compared to
      those reported for two standard test species, mysid shrimp (Americamysis bahia)
      and inland silverside (Menidia beryillina). This comparison showed that the %CV
      for the lobster toxicity tests were lower than those for the standard species
      tests indicating that the described larval lobster toxicity bioassay produces
      reliable and repeatable results.

TI  - Obtaining Hexoses from Chitosan through Depolymerization with Nitrous Acid.
LID - 10.2174/1570179419666220127145745 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Residues from shrimp farming have a great potential for
      sugar production and, consequently, an increase in the production of derivatives 
      for the low-carbon chemical industry. Obtaining bioactives from chitosan has been
      extensively investigated using different methodologies. The purpose of this work 
      was to study the chitosan depolymerization reaction aiming at the production of
      monomers without the use of additional enzymes or mineral acids. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: In this work, we systematically study the effect of sodium nitrite
      concentration and reaction conditions (pH and temperature ranges) in acetic acid 
      solvent on the chitosan depolymerization reaction aiming at the production of
      monomers, specifically 2,5-anhydromannose, without the use of additional enzymes 
      or mineral acids. RESULTS: The results indicated that only a small range of
      reaction conditions and nitrite concentrations allow for obtaining the monomer,
      while in most combinations of these parameters, oligomers are obtained. We found 
      that the temperature decisively affects the reaction yield, with the attainment
      of 2,5-anhydromannose favored at lower temperatures. CONCLUSION: The method
      proved to be simple and easy to perform allowing to obtain 2,5-anhydromannose
      with low-cost reagents. This monomer can be converted into several derivatives
      for industrial application (5-Hydroxymethylfurfural, ethanol, etc.).

      Antimicrobial Peptide Expression via a STING-Dependent DNA Sensing Pathway.
PG  - 818267
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2021.818267 [doi]
AB  - Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) are transcription factors found in both
      vertebrates and invertebrates that were recently identified and found to play an 
      important role in antiviral immunity in black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon. In
      this study, we investigated the mechanism by which P. monodon IRF (PmIRF)
      regulates the immune-related genes downstream of the cytosolic DNA sensing
      pathway. Depletion of PmIRF by double-stranded RNA-mediated gene silencing
      significantly reduced the mRNA expression levels of the IFN-like factors PmVago1,
      PmVago4, and PmVago5 and antilipopolysaccharide factor 6 (ALFPm6) in shrimp. In
      human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells transfected with PmIRF or co-transfected
      with DEAD-box polypeptide (PmDDX41) and simulator of IFN genes (PmSTING)
      expression plasmids, the promoter activity of IFN-beta, nuclear factor
      (NF-kappaB), and ALFPm6 was synergistically enhanced following stimulation with
      the nucleic acid mimics deoxyadenylic-deoxythymidylic acid sodium salt
      [poly(dA:dT)] and high molecular weight (HMW) polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid
      [poly(I:C)]. Both nucleic acid mimics also significantly induced PmSTING, PmIRF, 
      and ALFPm6 gene expression. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that PmIRF 
      interacted with PmSTING in cells stimulated with poly(dA:dT). PmSTING, PmIRF, and
      PmDDX41 were localized in the cytoplasm of unstimulated HEK293T cells and PmIRF
      and PmDDX41 were translocated to the nucleus upon stimulation with the nucleic
      acid mimics while PmSTING remained in the cytoplasm. These results indicate that 
      PmIRF transduces the pathogen signal via the PmDDX41-PmSTING DNA sensing pathway 
      to induce downstream production of interferon-like molecules and antimicrobial
      peptides.

TI  - [Dispersive solid-phase extraction combined with high-performance liquid
      chromatography for determination of seven anesthetics in aquatic products].
PG  - 139-147
LID - 10.3724/SP.J.1123.2021.08002 [doi]
AB  - Nowadays, anesthetics are widely used in fishery production processes, such as
      fish breeding, surgery, and fresh aquatic product transportation. Because of the 
      widespread application of anesthetic drugs in aquatic products, there is an
      increasing demand for the rapid and sensitive detection of anesthetic drugs in
      aquatic products. The complex aquatic product matrix contains a variety of
      interfering substances, such as proteins, fats, and phospholipids, along with
      anesthetic drug residues at very low concentrations; therefore, it is necessary
      to adopt appropriate pretreatment methods for improving the sensitivity of
      detection. In this study, a dispersive solid-phase extraction (DSPE) method,
      combined with high-performance liquid chromatography, was established for the
      simultaneous detection of seven anesthetic drugs in aquatic products, viz.
      procaine, oxybuprocaine, tricaine, eugenol, methyl eugenol, isoeugenol, and
      methyl isoeugenol. For the DSPE step, pretreatment conditions, such as extraction
      solvent, extraction time, adsorbent amount, and DMSO dosage, were optimized.
      Sample pretreatment is a three-step process. First, in ultrasound-assisted
      extraction, 2.0 g samples were extracted using 10.0 mL 1.0% formic acid in
      acetonitrile under ultrasound conditions for 10 min. Then, DSPE was performed
      with mixed adsorbents: the solvent extracts were cleaned using 20 mg
      poly(styrene-glycidylmethacrylate) microspheres (PS-GMA), 50 mg primary secondary
      amines (PSA), and 10 mg C18, followed by separation by centrifugation. Finally,
      DMSO-assisted concentration was applied: the organic layer was collected and was 
      dried at 40 in a N2 stream with 100 muL DMSO. Water was added to the residue to
      obtain a final volume of 1.0 mL for HPLC analysis. The seven anesthetic drugs
      were separated on a Welch welchrom C18 column (250 mmx4.6 mm, 5 mum) by gradient 
      elution using methanol and 0.05% formic acid in 5 mmol/L ammonium acetate aqueous
      solution as mobile phases. The detection wavelengths were 235, 260, and 290 nm.
      Two matrix matching standard curves for fish and shrimp were applied for
      quantitative analysis. Under optimized conditions, the seven target anesthetics
      showed good linear relationships in their respective concentration ranges
      (R(2)>0.999), with the limit of detection (LOD) ranging from 0.011 to 0.043
      mg/kg. In fish samples, the mean recoveries obtained at three concentration
      levels were between 79.7% and 109%, with relative standard deviations (RSDs)
      being less than 7.2%. In shrimp samples, mean recoveries were 78.0%-99.9%, with
      RSDs being less than 8.3%. This simple, rapid, accurate, and sensitive method can
      be applied to the detection of three kinds of aminobenzoic acid esters and four
      kinds of eugenol anesthetic drugs in aquatic products.

AB  - Nanoplastic pollution has become a major issue in the aquatic environment while
      there are few studies examined the effects of nanoplastic exposure on
      crustaceans. To investigate this issue, we exposed juvenile shrimp, Macrobrachium
      nipponense to 75 nm polystyrene with 0, 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg/L nanoplastics
      concentrations for 28 days. The effects of nanoplastic exposure on the
      microstructure of the hepatopancreas, digestive enzyme activity and expression of
      growth-related genes were studied. The results showed that (1) adverse effects on
      the hepatopancreas were positively correlated with nanoplastic concentration;
      (David et al.) the activity of lipase, trypsin and pepsin was initially promoted 
      and then inhibited with increasing nanoplastic concentration, whereas the
      activity of amylase was not significantly affected; (3) molting-associated genes 
      were initially promoted and then inhibited with increasing nanoplastic
      concentration; (4) CDK2 gene was first cloned and molecular characteristics were 
      analyzed. (5) polystyrene nanoplastics concentration >10 mg/L showed inhibition
      effect on CDK2 expression. These results indicated that nanoplastics affect the
      growth, digestive enzyme activity, hepatopancreas function and growth-related
      gene expression. Capsule: Our results identified the effects of nanoplastics on
      the growth performance of Macrobrachium nipponense in terms of digestion and
      molting.

TI  - TBC domain family 7-like enhances the tolerance of Penaeus vannamei to ammonia
      nitrogen by the up-regulation of autophagy.

AB  - TBC domain family 7 (TBC1D7) is one of the subunits of tuberous sclerosis complex
      (TSC) and an important regulator of autophagosome biogenesis. However, the
      function of TBC1D7 is not fully understood in crustaceans. In the present study, 
      TBC1D7 was identified from Penaeus vannamei. The complete coding sequence of
      PvTBC1D7 was of 960 bp encoding a predicted polypeptide of 319 amino acids with
      one conserved TBC domain, which shared high similarity with TBC1D7 of that other 
      species. The mRNA of PvTBC1D7 was highly expressed in hemocyte and
      hepatopancreas, and the PvTBC1D7 protein was localized specifically in the
      cytoplasm of hemocyte of shrimp. Besides, PvTBC1D7 was co-localized with PvTSC1
      in the cytoplasm of shrimp, indicating that there might existed a binding
      relationship between PvTBC1D7 and PvTSC1. During the ammonia nitrogen stress, the
      mRNA transcripts of PvTBC1D7 were significantly upregulated in hemocyte,
      hepatopancreas, and gill. Functionally, overexpression of PvTBC1D7 in vitro
      restored the inhibition to autophagy caused by chloroquine (CLQ) and increased
      the autophagy level, while the silencing of PvTBC1D7 could inhibit the autophagy.
      More importantly, after interfering with PvTBC1D7, the autophagy level decreased 
      significantly both in hepatopancreas and hemocyte of P. vannamei, the mRNA
      expression of PvmTOR was increased remarkably with the significantly decrease of 
      autophagy-related genes (PvATG12 and PvATG14). And the reduction of PvTBC1D7
      remarkably exacerbated the damage of hepatopancreas, increased the accumulation
      of ROS, and reduced the survival proportion of shrimp under ammonia nitrogen
      stress. Altogether, these results indicated that PvTBC1D7 might positively
      regulate the autophagy by stabilizing the negative regulation of mTOR by TSC
      complex, reduce the oxidative stress damage and improve shrimp ammonia nitrogen
      tolerance.

TI  - First report of Metschnikowia bicuspidata infection in Chinese grass shrimp
      (Palaemonetes sinensis) in China.
LID - 10.1111/tbed.14460 [doi]
AB  - The Chinese grass shrimp (Palaemonetes sinensis) was found with a white turbidity
      appearance in the Panjin area. After dissection, typical symptoms of milky
      disease with hemolymph emulsification and noncoagulation were observed; however, 
      the pathogen was unknown. In this study, we aimed to isolate the pathogen of the 
      diseased P. sinensis. We found that the pathogen could grow on the fungal medium 
      Bengal red, and microscopic examination showed that it reproduced by budding.
      Molecular identification of the isolated and purified yeast strain LNMB2021 based
      on 26S rDNA sequence showed that the pathogenic pathogen was Metschnikowia
      bicuspidata (GenBank OK094821), with 98.74% homology with M. bicuspidata strain
      LNES0119 (GenBank OK073903) and 98.56% with M. bicuspidata strain Liao (GenBank
      MT856369). The results of an artificial infection test showed that M. bicuspidata
      caused the same clinical symptoms in P. sinensis, and the isolated pathogen was
      still the same, which proved that P. sinensis was a new host of M. bicuspidata.
      Histopathological analysis showed that there were obvious pathological changes in
      the hepatopancreas and muscle tissue of the diseased P. sinensis. Identification 
      of the pathogen is essential for the prevention and control of the disease and
      the healthy culture of P. sinensis. Furthermore, considering the transmissibility
      and cross-host transmission of M. bicuspidata, its risk of infecting other
      aquatic animals deserves high attention.

AB  - Infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV) is a nonenveloped,
      linear, single-stranded DNA virus belonging to the family Parvoviridae and is a
      World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)-notifiable crustacean pathogen. During
      screening of Penaeus vannamei shrimp from 3 commercial shrimp facilities in the
      United States for a panel of OIE-listed (n = 7) and nonlisted (n = 2) crustacean 
      diseases, shrimp from these facilities tested positive for IHHNV. Nucleotide
      sequences of PCR amplicons showed 99%-100% similarity to IHHNV isolates from
      Latin America and Asia. The whole genome of the isolates also showed high
      similarity to type 2 infectious forms of IHHNV. Phylogenetic analysis using
      capsid gene and whole-genome sequences demonstrated that the isolates clustered
      with an IHHNV isolate from Ecuador. The detection of an OIE-listed crustacean
      pathogen in the United States highlights the need for biosecurity protocols in
      hatcheries and grow-out ponds to mitigate losses.

TI  - [Emission Characteristics, Transformation Mechanism, and Reduction Potential of
      Ammonia Emissions from a Crop Rotation System in Yangtze River Delta].
PG  - 1108-1128
LID - 10.13227/j.hjkx.202105291 [doi]
AB  - To study the characteristics and reduction potential of the ammonia emissions of 
      a crop rotation system in the Yangtze River Delta, we monitored and compared the 
      ammonia fluxes from two rotation systems:a conventional rice/winter wheat
      rotation system and a rice-shrimp cultivation/Chinese milk vetch rotation system.
      This study was conducted through closing chamber methods to investigate the
      influencing factors and transformation mechanism of ammonium emissions between
      the two studied cultivation patterns. Additionally, we established the
      temporal-spatial emission inventory by sorting out the local ammonia emission
      factors of farmland in the Yangtze River Delta in the last ten years. The
      emission reduction effects under different ammonia emission reduction paths were 
      also obtained. The results showed that, the cumulative amount of ammonia
      emissions throughout the whole monitoring year for the conventional rice/winter
      wheat rotation system (CR-W) and the rice-shrimp cultivation/Chinese milk vetch
      rotation system (RS-C) were 65.95 and 20.31 kg.hm(-2), respectively, whereas the 
      ammonia loss rates of CR-W and RS-C were 10.86% and 9.20%, respectively. Field
      surface water NH4(+)-N, field surface water pH, and topsoil NH4(+)-N were the
      major internal factors of ammonia emissions from paddy fields, whereas topsoil
      NH4(+)-N and atmospheric temperature had an important impact on ammonia emissions
      in the wheat season. The ammonia flux/field NH4(+)-N ratio (ARN) of field surface
      water under the CR and RS modes in the rice season reached 0.35+/-0.27 and
      0.14+/-0.19, respectively, which was 10-25 times that of topsoil in the wheat
      season, such that the ammonia emission flux in the rice season was significantly 
      higher than that in the wheat season. Under the conditions of high field water pH
      (8.0-9.0), atmospheric temperature (>28), and wind speed (>5.0 m.s(-1)), the
      ammonia flux/field NH4(+)-N ratios (ARN) were around 1.6-4.6 times that under low
      pH, temperature, and wind speed conditions, indicating that those three factors
      were the main factors affecting the conversion of NH4(+)-N from farmland to
      atmospheric NH3. Fertilization types also had significant effects on ARN; under
      different conditions, the ARN of urea was 1.5-5.5 times that of organic
      fertilizer. In 2019, the ammonia emission flux of rice and wheat under a
      conventional planting pattern in the Yangtze River Delta were (49.2+/-17.6)
      kg.hm(-2) and (16.0+/-13.5) kg.hm(-2), respectively, whereas the ammonia loss
      rates of rice and wheat were (20.1+/-5.7)% and (5.9+/-3.6)%, respectively. The
      ammonia emission loss rate of the former was about three times that of the
      latter. The ammonia emission inventory built by local factors shows that the
      total ammonia emissions of the farmland rotation system in the Yangtze River
      Delta reached (400.3+/-206.4) kt in 2019, which was mainly concentrated in the
      central and northern regions of Anhui province and Jiangsu province, and the
      ammonia emission intensity reached (1.33+/-1.39) t.km(-2). The selection of
      different emission factors had a relatively large impact on the change range of
      the inventory results, reaching the standard of -51.6%~51.6%. Through combing and
      analyzing the six main paths of ammonia emission reduction in farmland, it was
      found that nitrogen fertilizer synergism was the best way to reduce ammonia
      emissions, with the efficiency of (30.9+/-51.4)%; however, the grain yield
      increase rate was (-4.2+/-17.4)%, with great uncertainty. The ammonia emission
      reduction effect of adding soil additives was relatively poor (-5.4+/-45.1)%;
      however, the grain yield increase rate was the highest among those of the six
      emission reduction paths, reaching (6.8+/-23.9)%. The ammonia emission reduction 
      effect and grain yield increase rate of the ecological planting and breeding mode
      were (22.3+/-15.1)% and (5.6+/-3.8)%, respectively, which had the advantages of
      reducing ammonia emissions and increasing crop yield.

AB  - Very little is known about how microbiome interactions shape the horizontal
      transfer of antibiotic resistance genes in aquacultural environment. To this end,
      we first conducted 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to monitor the dynamics of
      bacterial community compositions in one shrimp farm from 2019 to 2020. Next,
      co-occurrence analysis was then conducted to reveal the interactions network
      between Vibrio spp. and other species. Subsequently, 21 V. parahaemolyticus
      isolates and 15 related bacterial species were selected for whole-genome
      sequencing (WGS). The 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing results identified a
      remarkable increase of Vibrio and Providencia in September-2019 and a significant
      rise of Enterobacter and Shewanella in Septtember-2020. Co-occurrence analysis
      revealed that Vibrio spp. positively interacted with the above species, leading
      to the sequencing of their isolates to further understand the sharing of the
      resistant genomic islands (GIs). Subsequent pan-genomic analysis of V.
      parahaemolyticus genomes identified 278 horizontally transferred genes in 10 GIs,
      most of which were associated with antibiotic resistance, virulence, and fitness 
      of metabolism. Most of the GIs have also been identified in Providencia, and
      Enterobacter, suggesting that exchange of genetic traits might occur in V.
      parahaemolyticus and other cooperative species in a specific niche. No genetic
      exchange was found between the species with negative relationships. The knowledge
      generated from this study would greatly improve our capacity to predict and
      mitigate the emergence of new resistant population and provide practical guidance
      on the microbial management during the aquacultural activities.

      signaling in an invertebrate.

AB  - Flagellin is a key bacterial virulence factor that can stimulate molecular immune
      signaling in both animals and plants. The detailed mechanisms of recognizing
      flagellin and mounting an efficient immune response have been uncovered in
      vertebrates; however, whether invertebrates can discriminate flagellin remains
      largely unknown. In the present study, the homolog of human SHOC2 leucine rich
      repeat scaffold protein in kuruma shrimp (Marsupenaeus japonicus), designated
      MjShoc2, was found to interact with Vibrio anguillarum flagellin A (FlaA) using
      yeast two-hybrid and pull-down assays. MjShoc2 plays a role in antibacterial
      response by mediating the FlaA-induced expression of certain antibacterial
      effectors, including lectin and antimicrobial peptide. FlaA challenge, via
      MjShoc2, led to phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinase (Erk), and the 
      subsequent activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat),
      ultimately inducing the expression of effectors. Therefore, by establishing the
      FlaA/MjShoc2/Erk/Stat signaling axis, this study revealed a new antibacterial
      strategy in shrimp, and provides insights into the flagellin sensing mechanism in
      invertebrates.

AB  - Microplastics are now found throughout the world's oceans, and although many
      organisms ingest microplastics, less is known about how plastics in seawater may 
      affect key processes such as feeding rate, growth, and survival. We used a series
      of laboratory experiments to test whether microplastics in seawater affected the 
      feeding rates of larvae of the California Grunion, Leuresthes tenuis. In
      addition, we tested whether trophic transfer of microplastics from zooplankton to
      larval fish can occur and affect growth and survival of fish. We measured feeding
      rates of grunion larvae at various concentrations of 75-90 microm and 125-250
      microm polyethylene microplastics and under both still water and turbulent
      conditions. In these experiments, exposure to microplastics had modest effects on
      feeding rates, though responses may be somewhat complex. Low concentrations of
      microplastics increased feeding rates compared to the control, but at higher
      concentrations, feeding rates were indistinguishable from those in the control
      group, though effects were small compared to natural variation in feeding rates
      among individual fish. Experiments to test for trophic transfer of microplastics 
      revealed that grunion larvae that were fed brine shrimp exposed to high
      concentrations of microplastics had lower growth rates and elevated mortality
      rates. Overall, our results suggest that the direct effects of microplastics on
      feeding rates of California Grunion during the early larval phase are minor,
      while the trophic transfer of microplastics from zooplankton to larval fish may
      have significant effects on their growth and survival. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

AB  - Multi-drug resistance (MDR) in bacteria is regarded as an emerging pollutant in
      different food production avenues including aquaculture. One hundred and sixty
      out of 2304 bacterial isolates from shrimp farm samples (n = 192) of Andhra
      Pradesh, India, were MDR. Based on biochemical identification and 16S rRNA
      sequencing, they were grouped into 35 bacterial species with the predominance of 
      Vibrio parahaemolyticus (12.5%). The MDR isolates showed highest resistance
      toward oxytetracycline (89%) with more than 0.2 MAR (multiple antibiotic
      resistance), demonstrates a high-risk source. The most prevalent
      antibiotic-resistance gene (ARG) and mobile genetic element (MGE) detected were
      tetA (47.5%) and int1 (46.2%), respectively. In conjugation experiments, overall 
      transfer frequency was found to be in the range of 1.1 x 10(-9) to 1.8 x 10(-3)
      with the transconjugants harbouring ARGs and MGEs. This study exposed the wide
      distribution of MDR bacteria in shrimp and its environment, which can further
      aggravate the already raised concerns of antibiotic residues in the absence of
      proper mitigation measures.

AB  - In recent years, the shrimp farming industry encountered significant economic
      losses induced by Vibrio alginolyticus. In this study, the influence of Vibrio
      alginolyticus on intestinal histomorphology and microbiome composition in
      Litopenaeus vannamei were studied. The results showed that the intestinal mucosal
      epithelial cells of Vibrio group (VA group) injected only with Vibrio
      alginolyticus showed large area exfoliation at 12 h, and the tissue morphology of
      intestine recovered at 48 h. Compared with the control group (CK group), the
      abundance of Proteobacteria was significantly higher (P < 0.05), while the
      abundance of Actinobacteria was significantly lower after infection with Vibrio
      alginolyticus. The abundance of Shewanella in intestinal microbiome of
      Litopenaeus vannamei was significantly higher at 12 h (P < 0.05), but the
      abundance of Candidatus_Bacilloplasma was significantly lower at 48 h after
      infection (P < 0.05). In VA group, the diversity of intestinal microbiome was
      significantly lower at 12 h, which could be caused by the proliferation of
      Candidatus_Bacilloplasma and Shewanella. All above findings suggested that the
      stability of the dynamic balance of microbiome in the intestine helped
      Litopenaeus vannamei to resist pathogen colonization.

AB  - Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) is a toxic substance that threatens the health of aquatic 
      animals. Hepatopancreas is the target organ of MC-LR toxicity. In this study, we 
      investigated the effects of MC-LR on hepatopancreas lipid metabolism and
      lipidomic responses in Litopenaeus vannamei. After MC-LR exposure for 72 h, the
      hepatopancreas showed obvious tissue damage, and the activities of several lipase
      isoenzymes were decreased. Furthermore, the relative gene expression levels of
      lipolysis (CPT1, AMPKalpha), lipogenesis (SREBP, FAS, ACC, 6PGD), and long-chain 
      fatty acid beta-oxidation (ACDL, ACDVL, ACBP) were increased. MC-LR exposure also
      affected lipidomics homeostasis. Specifically, the levels of glycerophospholipids
      (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidic acid, lyso-phosphatidylcholine,
      lyso-phosphatidylethanolamine, lyso-phosphatidylglycerol), sphingolipids
      (sphingomyelin and ceramides) and cholesteryl ester were increased, and those of 
      phosphatidylinositol and triglyceride were decreased. The significantly altered
      lipid molecules were mainly associated with the pathways of lipid and fatty acid 
      metabolism and autophagy. These results reveal that MC-LR exposure influences
      lipid metabolism and lipidomic homeostasis in the shrimp hepatopancreas.

AB  - This study investigated the trophic transfer of nanoplastics in marine food
      chains. We fed nanoplastic-exposed Artemia franciscana (brine shrimp) to
      Larimichthys polyactis (small yellow croaker) daily for eight days. Subsequently,
      the overall health condition, histopathological damage to the liver and digestive
      tract, and swimming ability of the fish were measured. After the sub-acute
      exposure to nanoplastics via trophic transfer, the fish showed inhibited growth, 
      severe liver damage, as well as a poorer swimming ability compared to the
      control. The swimming ability was especially affected, in terms of the overall
      movement as well as thigmotaxis. The results thus clarified that even an indirect
      exposure to nanoplastics could induce neurotoxic effects and affect the swimming 
      ability of the fish. As fish are well-known human food resources, the possibility
      of such trophic transfers affecting higher trophic level organisms, such as
      humans, cannot be ruled out.

AB  - Contamination is likely to affect the composition of an ecological landscape,
      leading to the rupture of ecological connectivity among habitats (ecological
      fragmentation), which may impact on the distribution, persistence and abundance
      of populations. In the current study, different scenarios within a spatially
      heterogeneous landscape were simulated in the Heterogeneous Multi-Habitat Assay
      System (HeMHAS) to evaluate the potential effect that contamination (copper at
      0.5 and 25 mug/L) might have on habitat selection by the estuarine shrimp
      Palaemon varians in combination with two other ecological factors: predator
      presence and food availability. As a result, P. varians detected and avoided
      copper; however, in the presence of the predation signal, shrimps shifted their
      response by moving to previously avoided regions, even if this resulted in a
      higher exposure to contamination. When encouraged to move towards environments
      with a high availability of food, a lower connectivity among the shrimp
      populations isolated by both contamination and predation risk simultaneously was 
      evidenced, when compared to populations isolated only by the risk of predation.
      These results indicate that contamination might: (i) trigger avoidance in
      shrimps, (ii) prevent colonization of attractive foraging areas, (iii) enhance
      populations' isolation and (iv), make populations more susceptible to local
      extinction.

      Extract.
PG  - 17-26
LID - 10.2147/JEP.S339383 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mangroves contain several bioactive compounds, some of which have
      been used for centuries as remedies for several ailments. METHODS: Foliar parts
      of Excoecaria agallocha were extracted in organic solvents and in water using a
      Soxhlet apparatus and evaluated for antimicrobial activity against nine
      type-culture pathogens, six clinical isolates, and two fungal pathogens with agar
      well diffusion assays. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum
      bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined by broth dilution and extracts
      further subjected to brine-shrimp cytotoxic assays using Artemia salina. Chemical
      constituents were analyzed with thin-layer chromatography (TLC), gas
      chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS), and Fourier-transform infrared
      spectroscopy (FT-IR). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Ethyl acetate extract displayed the
      broadest antimicrobial activity. Isolates of Staphylococcus aureus were found to 
      be the most susceptible among the clinical and type-culture groups corresponding 
      to inhibition zones: 17.3+/-1.1 and 23.5+/-1.3 mm in diameter, respectively.
      Anticandidal activity was found to be lower against Candida albicans and C.
      tropicalis (10.3+/-0.6 and 11.9+/-0.85 mm diameter). Also, this extract was found
      to be bactericidal for S. aureus and Micrococcus luteus (MBC:MIC </=2). C
      cytotoxic activity LD50 was 521 microg/mL. On GC-MS, squalene [(6E, 10E, 4E,
      18E)-2,6,10,15,19,23-hexamethyltetracosa-2,6,10,14,18,22-hexaene] was the major
      compound. Bioassay-guided (antibacterial) TLC revealed the presence of one major 
      active fraction, F2, with an Rf value of 1.21. FT-IR analysis of this fraction
      also implied that it was squalene, which might have a functional role in the
      mechanism of chemical defense.

AB  - The present study was designed to evaluate polarity-dependent extraction
      efficiency and pharmacological profiling of Polygonum glabrum Willd. Crude
      extracts of leaves, roots, stems, and seeds, prepared from solvents of varying
      polarities, were subjected to phytochemical, antioxidant, antibacterial,
      antifungal, antidiabetic, and cytotoxicity assays. Maximum extraction yield
      (20.0% w/w) was observed in the case of an acetone:methanol (AC:M) root extract. 
      Distilled water:methanol (W:M) leaves extract showed maximum phenolic contents.
      Maximum flavonoid content and free radical scavenging potential were found in
      methanolic (M) seed extract. HPLC-DAD quantification displayed the manifestation 
      of substantial quantities of quercetin, rutin, gallic acid, quercetin, catechin, 
      and kaempferol in various extracts. The highest ascorbic acid equivalent total
      antioxidant capacity and reducing power potential was found in distilled water
      roots and W:M leaf extracts, respectively. Chloroform (C) seeds extract produced 
      a maximum zone of inhibition against Salmonella typhimurium. Promising protein
      kinase inhibition and antifungal activity against Mucor sp. were demonstrated by 
      C leaf extract. AC:M leaves extract exhibited significant cytotoxic capability
      against brine shrimp larvae and alpha-amylase inhibition. Present results suggest
      that the nature of pharmacological responses depends upon the polarity of
      extraction solvents and parts of the plant used. P. glabrum can be considered as 
      a potential candidate for the isolation of bioactive compounds with profound
      therapeutic importance.

TI  - Lipid Profiles of the Heads of Four Shrimp Species by UPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap/MS
      and Their Cardiovascular Activities.

LID - 10.3390/molecules27020350 [doi]
AB  - Lipids are key factors in nutrition, structural function, metabolic features, and
      other biological functions. In this study, the lipids from the heads of four
      species of shrimp (Fenneropenaeus chinensis (FC), Penaeus japonicus (PJ), Penaeus
      vannamei (PV), and Procambarus clarkia (PCC)) were compared and characterized
      based on UPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap/MS. We compared the differences in lipid
      composition of four kinds of shrimp head using multivariate analysis. In
      addition, a zebrafish model was used to evaluate pro-angiogenic,
      anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, and cardioprotective activities of the shrimp
      head lipids. The lipids from the four kinds of shrimp head had different degrees 
      of pro-angiogenic activities, and the activities of PCC and PJ shrimp lipids were
      more significant than those of the other two species. Four lipid groups displayed
      strong anti-inflammatory activities. For antithrombotic activity, only PCC (25
      mug/mL) and PV (100 mug/mL) groups showed obvious activity. In terms of
      cardioprotective activity, the four kinds of lipid groups significantly increased
      the zebrafish heart rhythms. The heart distances were shortened, except for those
      of the FC (100 mug/mL) and PJ (25 mug/mL) groups. Our comprehensive lipidomics
      analysis and bioactivity study of lipids from different sources could provide a
      basis for the better utilization of shrimp.

TI  - Circulating Phylotypes of White Spot Syndrome Virus in Bangladesh and Their
      Virulence.
LID - 191 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10010191 [doi]
AB  - White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV) has emerged as one of the most prevalent and
      lethal viruses globally and infects both shrimps and crabs in the aquatic
      environment. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of WSSV in different 
      ghers of Bangladesh and the virulence of the circulating phylotypes. We collected
      360 shrimp (Penaeus monodon) and 120 crab (Scylla sp.) samples from the
      south-east (Cox's Bazar) and south-west (Satkhira) coastal regions of Bangladesh.
      The VP28 gene-specific PCR assays and sequencing revealed statistically
      significant (p < 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test) differences in the prevalence of WSSV
      in shrimps and crabs between the study areas (Cox's Bazar and Satkhira) and over 
      the study periods (2017-2019). The mean Log load of WSSV varied from 8.40 (Cox's 
      Bazar) to 10.48 (Satkhira) per gram of tissue. The mean values for salinity,
      dissolved oxygen, temperature and pH were 14.71 +/- 0.76 ppt, 3.7 +/- 0.1 ppm,
      34.11 +/- 0.38 degrees C and 8.23 +/- 0.38, respectively, in the WSSV-positive
      ghers. The VP28 gene-based phylogenetic analysis showed an amino-acid
      substitution (E-->G) at the 167th position in the isolates from Cox's Bazar
      (referred to as phylotype BD2) compared to the globally circulating one (BD1).
      Shrimp PL artificially challenged with BD1 and BD2 phylotypes with filtrates of
      tissue containing 0.423 x 10(9) copies of WSSV per mL resulted in a median LT50
      value of 73 h and 75 h, respectively. The in vivo trial showed higher mean Log
      WSSV copies (6.47 +/- 2.07 per mg tissue) in BD1-challenged shrimp PL compared to
      BD2 (4.75 +/- 0.35 per mg tissue). Crabs infected with BD1 and BD2 showed 100%
      mortality within 48 h and 62 h of challenge, respectively, with mean Log WSSV
      copies of 12.06 +/- 0.48 and 9.95 +/- 0.37 per gram tissue, respectively.
      Moreover, shrimp antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), penaeidin and lysozyme expression
      were lower in the BD1-challenged group compared to BD2 challenged shrimps. These 
      results collectively demonstrated that relative virulence properties of WSSV
      based on mortality rate, viral load and expression of host immune genes in
      artificially infected shrimp PL could be affected by single aa substitution in
      VP28.

TI  - Basic Studies Aiming at Orius minutus (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) Mass-Rearing.
LID - 77 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/insects13010077 [doi]
AB  - This study presented biological and economic data for the mass-rearing of Orius
      minutus in Korea. Simplifying the mass-rearing process through an alternative
      diet and an artificial oviposition substrate is a prerequisite for enhancing the 
      usability of this insect as a biological control agent. We compare the hatch rate
      of O. minutus eggs deposited on a plant substrate with that of eggs deposited on 
      two artificial substrates, cork sheets and rubber. The results indicate that cork
      sheet is the most cost-effective artificial oviposition substrate for the
      mass-rearing of O. minutus. We also examine five feeding treatments that included
      two types of brine shrimp eggs and eggs of Ephestia cautella to compare the
      number of eggs laid in the fifth generation. We found no significant difference
      between the two treatment groups; 61.3 eggs were laid in the treatment group fed 
      iron-coated brine shrimp and moth eggs, and 67.4 eggs were laid in the control
      group. The plant-free model developed in our study can reduce rearing costs by
      70.5% compared to the conventional mass-rearing model.

TI  - Whole Wheat Crackers Fortified with Mixed Shrimp Oil and Tea Seed Oil
      Microcapsules Prepared from Mung Bean Protein Isolate and Sodium Alginate.
LID - 202 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/foods11020202 [doi]
AB  - Shrimp oil (SO) rich in n-3 fatty acids and astaxanthin, mixed with
      antioxidant-rich tea seed oil (TSO), was microencapsulated using mung bean
      protein isolate and sodium alginate and fortified into whole wheat crackers. SO
      and TSO mixed in equal proportions were emulsified in a solution containing mung 
      bean protein isolate (MBPI) and sodium alginate (SA) at varied ratios. The
      emulsions were spray-dried to entrap SO-TSO in MBPI-SA microcapsules. MBPI-SA
      microcapsules loaded with SO-TSO showed low to moderately high encapsulation
      efficiencies (EE) of 32.26-72.09% and had a fair flowability index. Two selected 
      microcapsules with high EE possessed the particle sizes of 1.592 and 1.796 microm
      with moderate PDI of 0.372 and 0.403, respectively. Zeta potential values were
      -54.81 mV and -53.41 mV. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images indicated
      that microcapsules were spherical in shape with some shrinkage on the surface and
      aggregation took place to some extent. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and
      differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses of samples empirically validated
      the presence of SO-TSO in the microcapsules. Encapsulated SO-TSO showed superior 
      oxidative stability and retention of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to
      unencapsulated counterparts during storage of 6 weeks. When SO-TSO microcapsules 
      were fortified in whole wheat crackers at varying levels (0-10%), the crackers
      showed sensorial acceptability with no perceivable fishy odor. Thus,
      microencapsulation of SO-TSO using MBPI-SA as wall materials could be used as an 
      alternative carrier system, in which microcapsules loaded with PUFAs could be
      fortified in a wide range of foods.
